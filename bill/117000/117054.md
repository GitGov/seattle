    ORDINANCE _________________  
  
    AN ORDINANCE relating to skybridge and other structure term  
    permits; amending the current Seattle Department of  
    Transportation Street Use Fee Schedule, Exhibit A to  
    Ordinance 122295, by adopting a term permit schedule of  
    fees, and establishing a term permit fee methodology.  
  
    WHEREAS, Section 15.04.074 of the Seattle Municipal Code  
    authorizes and directs the Seattle Department of  
    Transportation (SDOT) Director to prepare and recommend  
    to the City Council, for adoption by ordinance, a  
    schedule of permit fees applicable to all permits for the  
    use of public places under the jurisdiction of the  
    Seattle Department of Transportation. The fees for using  
    the city's rights-of-way are to be commensurate with the  
    cost of administration, review, inspection, and policing  
    involved in issuing and continuing the permits and may  
    take into consideration the undesirability of the use or  
    occupation relative to the rights of the public such as  
    the City policy of discouraging encroachments  
    inconsistent with the public's right of access to right-  
    of-way; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Section 15.64.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code  
    directs the Council to limit the proliferation and  
    adverse effects of skybridges; and  
  
    WHEREAS, by Ordinance 121855, the City authorized the SDOT  
    Director to adjust the annual term permit fee amount in  
    accordance with a term permit fee schedule adopted by the  
    Council; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Ordinance 122295 amended the Street Use Permit Fee  
    Schedule by adding term permit use codes for long-term  
    uses of the right-of-way and the subsequent fees were to  
    be determined by ordinance; NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
          Section 1.  Street Use Permit Fee Schedule, Exhibit A to  
    Ordinance No. 122295, is amended as follows:

Use area:  
  
Square footage of the permitted encroachment in the right-of-way, as authorized by Seattle Department of Transportation.  
  
Rate of return:  
  
Annualized rate of return on market value of the right-of-way, as established by the City Appraiser or a State of Washington Certified General Real Estate Appraiser retained by the Director of Transportation.  
  
Degree of alienation:  
  
For Term permits, the degree of impact on the public, utilities, right-of-way, and other potential uses of the right-of- way based on City policy, as established by Seattle Department of Transportation. Refer to Table A: Degree of Alienation Factor.

Section 2. Term permit fee implementation schedule. Term permits existing on the effective date of this ordinance shall have new annual fees applied starting on January 1, 2011, as authorized in Section 3 of this ordinance.

Section 3. Term permit fee phase-in schedule. Annual term permit fees for existing permitted term permits shall be phased in over a two year period. Starting in January 2011, the annual term permit fee will increase by 50 percent of the difference between the 2010 annual term permit fee and the new annual term permit fee based on the term permit fee methodology. Starting in January 2012, the annual term permit fee will increase to the full new annual term permit fee based on the term permit fee methodology. By the end of 2012, the phase-in period will be complete and all existing permitted term permits will be determined using the term permit fee methodology on an annual cycle. The new annual term permit fee will not be phased in if the new annual term permit fee is less than the 2010 annual term permit fee for existing permitted term permits, or an existing term permit is renewed by Council after the effective date of this ordinance and before December 31, 2011.  
  
Section 4. Severability. The provisions of this ordinance are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any portion of this ordinance, or the invalidity of its application to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this ordinance, or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.  
  
Section 5. This ordinance shall take effect and be in force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not approved and returned by the Mayor within ten days after presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Seattle Municipal Code Section 1.04.020; provided that if C.B. 117008 becomes an ordinance, then this ordinance shall take effect no earlier than one day after the effective date of the ordinance introduced as C.B. 117008.
