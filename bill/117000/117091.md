    WHEREAS, the City Council passed Ordinance 118687 on August  
    11, 1997, authorizing the Mayor to execute a Memorandum  
    of Agreement, and Ordinance 118836 on December 8, 1997,

    Utilities contributions of Public Infrastructure to the New

    Code is amended as follows:  
  
    21.04.280   Reserved.  (( Certification and  
    funding of water and sewer infrastructure extensions.  
    ))  
  
    (( A. As used in this section, the following  
    words shall have the following meanings:   
  
     "Eligible project" means any housing development  
    or redevelopment project in The City of Seattle that receives  
    a HUD utility allowance, in which at least fifty (50) percent  
    of the dwelling units will be affordable to and will be  
    occupied by households with aggregate annual incomes no higher  
    than fifty (50) percent of median income.   
  
     "Median income" means annual median income for  
    the Seattle-Everett   
  
     Metropolitan Statistical Area, adjusted for  
    household size, as provided from time to time by the U.S.  
    Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). If HUD  
    ceases to provide such estimates no less frequently than  
    annually, then "median income" shall mean such comparable  
    figure for the Seattle area or an area including Seattle,  
    published or reported by a federal, state, or local agency, as  
    the City shall select in its sole discretion.   
  
     "Public infrastructure" means the water,  
    wastewater and/or drainage infrastructure that is required to  
    be (a) constructed or installed under SMC Section 21.04.060 B,  
    SMC Section 21.16.270 B and/or SMC Chapter 23.53,  
    respectively, and any rules or policies that may be  
    promulgated thereunder; and (b) transferred to the City upon  
    completion of construction.   
  
     B. For housing development or redevelopment  
    projects certified by the Office of Housing as eligible  
    projects and that are required to construct public  
    infrastructure, Seattle Public Utilities shall, prior to  
    December 31, 2003, fund the actual cost of the public  
    infrastructure prorated according to the percentage of  
    dwelling units that will serve households with aggregate  
    annual incomes no higher than fifty (50) percent of median  
    income; provided that the property owner installs water and  
    electric meters (or submeters, as applicable) in the eligible  
    project and that all public infrastructure and all meter work  
    is performed in a manner acceptable to Seattle Public  
    Utilities. An amount equal to such funding shall be recovered  
    through increased water, wastewater and drainage charges  
    established by ordinance. The Office of Housing shall certify  
    only those projects that meet the criteria of eligible  
    projects and that also demonstrate to the satisfaction of the  
    Office that the property owner will comply with all applicable  
    state law, including without limitation public bidding and  
    prevailing wage laws, and with all applicable City law,  
    including without limitation laws pertaining to the prevention  
    of discrimination and women and minority business enterprises.  
    The Office of Housing, in agreement with Seattle Public  
    Utilities, is hereby authorized to develop rules and  
    procedures for certification of, and follow-up reporting by  
    eligible projects to ensure that they satisfy the intent of  
    the ordinance codified in this section. ))

G. Whereas, pursuant Ordinance 118605, as amended, and Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.04.280, Seattle Public Utilities has received, as of December 31, 2009, One Million Two Hundred Sixty-Two Thousand Five Hundred Forty ($1,262,540) through water and wastewater surcharges, which includes Three Hundred Eighty Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety Dollars ($380,990) in interest charges, from certain households at the New Holly Redevelopment Project for purposes of recovering the cost of Seattle Public Utility contributions of Public Infrastructure to the project.  
  
H. Whereas, Seattle Public Utilities and SHA recognize that the imposition and collection of water and wastewater surcharges are administratively burdensome and not the most efficient means of recovering the cost of Seattle Public Utility contributions of Public Infrastructure to the New Holly Redevelopment Project and that the establishment of a schedule of flat monthly payments would significantly simplify the recovery of the remaining unreimbursed cost of Seattle Public Utility contributions.  
  
NOW, THEREFORE, Seattle Public Utilities and the Seattle Housing Authority agree as follows:  
  
\1. As of December 31, 2009, the remaining unreimbursed cost of Seattle Public Utilities contributions of Public Infrastructure to the New Holly Redevelopment Project is One Million Nine Hundred Ninety-Six Thousand Six Hundred Twenty- Three Dollars ($1,996,623).  
  
\2. Beginning the first day of the month following the effective date of the City of Seattle Ordinance repealing the water and wastewater surcharge on consumption at the New Holly Redevelopment Project, Seattle Housing Authority will pay Seattle Public Utilities by the beginning of each month a flat amount, reflecting principal and interest, in accordance with the payment schedule, attached hereto as Exhibit A. Subject to the accelerated payment provisions set forth in Section 4, below, Seattle Housing Authority will continue to make such monthly payments through April 1, 2031. The April 1, 2031 final payment will be equal to the remaining balance. This schedule of payments includes interest based on an annual interest rate of 4.75 percent.  
  
\3. Seattle Public Utilities will provide to Seattle Housing Authority by January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each calendar year, a statement showing the outstanding balance of the unreimbursed cost as of the end of the previous month.  
  
\4. Seattle Housing Authority may accelerate its payments and retire all or part of the outstanding balance of unreimbursed costs. Partial acceleration of payment will not change the monthly amount due as stated in Section 2, above, but will shorten the term of the repayments. Any accelerated payments will be reflected on the quarterly statements from Seattle Public Utilities to Seattle Housing Authority. Seattle Housing Authority may retire all of the outstanding balance of unreimbursed costs at any time prior to February 2031 based on the most recent quarterly statement provided by Seattle Public Utilities.  
  
\5. No modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be effective unless a written amendment is executed by an authorized representative of Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle Housing Authority.  
  
\6. Default and remedies for breach or nonperformance of any term of this Agreement shall be governed by the provisions of Section 11.6 of the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum of Agreement.  
  
\7. Failure to promptly enforce compliance with any term or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver or limitation of any right or remedy under this Agreement.
