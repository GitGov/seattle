C. The fees for the following special hazards permits are established in Schedule C. See Table 22.602.045C.  
Special Hazards Permits  
  
Fees for special hazards permits are established in Schedule C (See Table 22.602.045 C). In some cases these fees are based on the quantity of hazardous material stored and/or handled at the site and the relative risk posed by each material.  
  
\1. Definitions:  
  
\a. "Quantity Range Number" as established in the Quantity Range Table below, is a number  
  
between 1 and 2 that is assigned to a hazard category based upon the amount of hazardous material located at the site.

c. "Fixed permit cost" is the minimum cost for the Seattle Fire Department to issue a  
hazardous material permit. The fixed permit cost is (( ~~~~ One hundred eighty-one Dollars ($181.00) ~~~~)) $208 .  
  
\d. "Base permit fee" is determined by multiplying the sum of the products of the quantity range  
  
number and assigned risk factor for each hazard class by the fixed permit cost (( ~~~~ divided by 1.1 ~~~~)) and is represented by the following equation:  
  
Base permit fee = [S (Q1)(R1) + (Q2)(R2) . . ..] [F(( ~~~~ /1.1 ~~~~))]  
  
Where: Q = The quantity range number.  
  
R = The assigned risk factor.  
  
F = The fixed permit cost (( ~~~~ $181.00 ~~~~)) $208  
  
When an individual material has multiple hazards, only the hazard presented by the hazard class that has been assigned the highest risk factor shall be considered in the fee calculation.  
  
Example:  
  
XYZ Company stores (( ~~~~ fifty ( ~~~~))50(( ~~~~ ) ~~~~)) gallons of gasoline and (( ~~~~ two hundred ( ~~~~))200(( ~~~~ ) ~~~~)) gallons of 50% nitric acid. Gasoline is classified as a Class I flammable liquid which has an assigned risk factor of 1.4. Nitric acid (50%) is classified as both a corrosive liquid and a Class 2 oxidizer. Because 50% nitric acid presents two separate hazards (corrosive and Class 2 oxidizer) only the Class 2 oxidizer hazard is considered in the fee calculation because it has an assigned risk factor of 1.2 compared to the 1.1 risk factor assigned to corrosives.  
  
Base permit fee = [(1)(1.4)flammable + (1.25)(1.2)Class 2 oxidizer] [(( ~~~~ $181.00 ~~~~)) $208 (( ~~~~ /1.1 ~~~~))]  
  
Base permit fee = (( ~~~~ $477.20 ~~~~)) $603.20  
  
Schedule C  
  
**Table 22.602.045 C**  
  
**Special hazards permits**  
  
**Schedule C** fee worksheet- based permits shall be renewed at one-half the permit origination fee or (( ~~$181.00 ~~))$208, which is the minimum renewal fee, whichever is greater.  
  
**Schedule C** flat-fee permits which had been grandfathered at below market rate permit fees under prior fee schedules will increase 25 percent annually beginning in 2009 until such time as they reach parity with renewal rates identified in the current Schedule C.

^1^**Schedule C** fee worksheet- based permits shall be renewed at one-half the permit origination fee or (( ~~$181.00 ~~))$208, which is the minimum renewal fee, whichever is greater.  
  
^2^ This temporary permit is valid for six months and is issued to a facility placed under a long-term compliance plan while the facility works towards full compliance with the Code. The fee is calculated to be half of the annual permit fee of the annual permit that will be issued to the facility once compliance is achieved. This permit cannot be renewed but additional 1070 permits can be issued as needed to cover the entire compliance plan period.  
  
**Schedule C** flat-fee permits which had been grandfathered at below market rate permit fees under prior fee schedules will increase 25 percent annually until such time as they reach parity with renewal rates identified in the current Schedule C.

4 Each applicant who receives a minimum of six (( ~~~~ (6) ~~~~)) permits (Code 4915) during a six (( ~~~~ (6) ~~~~)) month period and is found to be in compliance with all permit conditions will be considered a pre-approved applicant after the six (( ~~~~ (6) ~~~~)) month period.

D.

E. Temporary permits listed under Schedule A, B and C will not be renewed on an annual basis.  
  
F.

Any work activity or operation regulated by the code that commences before obtaining the necessary permits may be required to obtain a permit and pay 1.5 times the fee of the original permit. Where a compliance plan agreement has been reached for a permitted activity, the fire code official is authorized to require temporary permits to be issued in lieu of an annual permit until full compliance with the fire code regulations for that activity is achieved. The fee for such temporary permits shall be based on the cost of an annual permit pro-rated for the time period the temporary permit is valid.
