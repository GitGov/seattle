    ORDINANCE _________________  
  
    AN ORDINANCE relating to the 2008 Parks and Green Spaces Levy;  
    accepting the recommendations of the 2008 Parks and Green  
    Spaces Levy Oversight Committee concerning the  
    Development Category Inflation Adjustment and the  
    Opportunity Fund category; reallocating funds from the  
    Development Category to the Opportunity Fund Category;  
    and creating new major maintenance projects in the  
    Opportunity Fund Category; all by a three-fourths vote of  
    the City Council.  
  
    WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 authorized a proposition to  
    Seattle's voters, a Parks and Green Spaces Levy (Parks  
    Levy) to levy for up to six years regular property taxes  
    in excess of the limitation on levies in Chapter 84.55  
    RCW for the purposes of acquiring, developing, or  
    restoring parks, recreation facilities, cultural  
    facilities, green spaces, playfields, trails, community  
    gardens, and shoreline areas; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the proposed 2008 Parks Levy was approved by Seattle  
    voters on November 4, 2008; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 created four major funding  
    categories for levy funds: 1) Acquisition; 2)  
    Development; 3) Environment; and 4) Opportunity Fund; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Opportunity Fund category is to fund acquisition  
    and development projects not identified for funding in  
    the remainder of the 2008 Parks Levy program; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 established a Parks and Green Spaces  
    Levy Oversight Committee (Oversight Committee), with  
    responsibilities including advising upon expenditures and  
    allocations for the following year, making  
    recommendations on the implementation of particular  
    projects and any reallocations, adopting evaluation  
    criteria and recommending Opportunity Fund awards to the  
    Superintendent, Mayor, and City Council; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Parks and Green Spaces Levy Development Category  
    includes a $14 million inflation contingency to cover  
    escalating costs on construction and improvement projects  
    in future years;  and  
  
    WHEREAS, Parks Levy projects have not experienced inflation to  
    date and have benefitted from a very competitive bid  
    climate due to the economic recession; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the economic recession has led to declining Real  
    Estate Excise Tax (REET) revenues which fund major  
    maintenance projects in parks and other facilities; and  
  
    WHEREAS, based upon the absence of construction industry  
    inflation and reduced REET revenues, the Parks and Green  
    Spaces Levy Oversight Committee recognized that the best  
    use of the Development Category inflation adjustment  
    funds was to support the ongoing preservation of existing  
    park facilities; and  
  
    WHEREAS, on June 27, 2011, the Oversight Committee held a  
    public hearing on a preliminary recommendation to use  
    $9,758,000 of Development Category levy inflation  
    adjustment dollars to fund major maintenance projects and  
    received favorable citizen comment and support; and  
  
    WHEREAS, on July 25, 2011, the Oversight Committee voted in  
    favor of a final recommendation to use $9,758,000 of  
    Development Category levy inflation adjustment dollars to  
    fund major maintenance projects; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the recommended major maintenance projects are not  
    presently included in the Parks and Green Spaces Levy;  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, Ordinance 122749 provides that, after considering  
    recommendations made by the Oversight Committee, City  
    Council may create new projects in the Opportunity Fund  
    Category and, with a three-fourths vote, transfer Parks  
    Levy allocations across categories and subcategories; and  
  
    WHEREAS, it is anticipated that appropriations for the  
    recommended major maintenance projects will be included  
    in the 2012 Budget and the projects will be included in  
    the 2012-2017 Capital Improvement Program; NOW,  
    THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
          Section 1.  Effective January 1, 2012, the Parks and

    Development Category Inflation Adjustment to the Opportunity  
    Fund, and to allocate these funds for 17 high priority major  
    maintenance projects, is adopted.
