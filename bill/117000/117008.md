    ORDINANCE _________________  
  
    AN ORDINANCE relating to street and sidewalk use; amending the  
    Street Use Permit Fee Schedule authorized by Section  
    15.04.074 of the Seattle Municipal Code.  
  
    WHEREAS, Section 15.04.074 of the Seattle Municipal Code  
    authorizes and directs the Director of Transportation to  
    prepare and recommend to the City Council, for passage by  
    ordinance, a schedule of fees applicable to all street  
    and/or sidewalk use permits (hereinafter referred to as  
    the Street Use Permit Fee Schedule), commensurate with  
    the cost of administration, review, inspection, and  
    policing involved in the issuance and continuance of such  
    permits and the use thereby granted; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Use and Occupation fees currently subsidize the cost  
    of permit issuance and inspection and plan review and  
    Street Use permits need to fully recover their cost to  
    comply with the Seattle Municipal Code; and  
  
    WHEREAS, to recover the cost of doing business on overtime, a  
    premium rate for inspections and review shall be charged  
    to applicants who require that Street Use inspections or  
    other labor cost to occur on overtime; and  
  
    WHEREAS, it is appropriate that those wishing to use public  
    rights-of-way should bear the costs associated with  
    obtaining appropriate street improvement permits; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Street Use rates were adjusted January 1, 2004; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Utility Map Conversion project is terminated and  
    so the mapping fee surcharge is now retired; and  
  
    WHEREAS, there should be an economic disincentive for the long  
    term commercial occupation of the right-of-way for  
    private purposes; NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
         Section 1. The City's Street Use Permit Fee Schedule,  
    which was last amended by Ordinance 123100, is replaced by

    effective January 1, 2011.  
  
          Section 2.  This ordinance shall take effect and be in  
    force 30 days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if
