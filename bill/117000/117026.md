    AN ORDINANCE relating to drainage and wastewater services of  
    Seattle Public Utilities; adjusting wastewater and drainage  
    rates to pass through increased treatment costs charged by  
    King County; amending Sections 21.28.040 and 21.33.030 of the  
    Seattle Municipal Code to reflect the adjusted rates; and  
    amending Section 21.76.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code to  
    adjust credits to low-income drainage and wastewater  
    customers.  
  
    WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities' wastewater and drainage  
    rates are based on the sum of the treatment rate and system  
    rate for each utility and are designed to pass through the  
    wastewater and drainage shares of the rates King County  
    charges for its wastewater treatment services as part of the  
    treatment rate applicable to each utility; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Ordinances introduced as Council Bill Nos. 116926 and  
    116928 and adopted November 2010, established the 2011-2012  
    Seattle Public Utilities' wastewater volume rate and drainage  
    rates, respectively, based on the existing King County  
    wastewater treatment charge of $31.90; and  
  
    WHEREAS, King County adopted a new wastewater treatment rate  
    of $36.10 per residential customer equivalent per month  
    effective January 1, 2011, which is an increase of more than  
    10 percent over the existing treatment rate; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Subsections 21.28.040 B.1 and 21.33.030 D.1 allow the  
    treatment rates of each utility to be adjusted by ordinance at  
    any time in response to changes in the King County wastewater  
    rates; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the recently adopted Seattle Public Utilities' 2011  
    and 2012 wastewater and drainage treatment rates will not  
    provide sufficient revenues to pay the increased King County  
    treatment costs; and  
  
    WHEREAS, wastewater and drainage credits for qualified low-  
    income customers, not billed directly by SPU, are based on  
    typical residential bills, and credits for such customers need  
    to be revised to reflect the changes in the wastewater and  
    drainage rates; NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1. Subsection 21.28.040 B.3 of the Seattle Municipal
