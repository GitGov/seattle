    WHEREAS, in 2002, the Washington State Legislature enacted 2002  
    Washington Laws, ch. 248 (which was primarily codified as RCW Chapter  
    35.95A) to allow voters to create a "city transportation authority," a  
    municipal corporation that would have the power to plan, construct,  
    and operate a monorail transportation system; and  
  
    WHEREAS, in July 2002, the City of Seattle expressed its intent in  
    Resolution 30486 to facilitate fast, coordinated, cost-effective  
    construction of a Seattle monorail system, including expedited review  
    and approvals; and  
  
    WHEREAS, on November 5, 2002, Seattle voters passed Seattle Citizen

    which the City and the Seattle Monorail Project recognized that the  
    monorail transit facilities constituting Phase One of the Seattle  
    Popular Monorail Plan are an essential public facility within the  
    meaning of the state Growth Management Act and that the timely and
