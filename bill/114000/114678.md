    business of transporting freight for hire, as to such persons, the

    that section.  The gross contract price shall be allocated to  
    the city with which the contract is made. No other city shall have  
    jurisdiction to tax the gross receipts from such contract.  The

    gross receipts tax," the tax must be imposed at the local level)).  
  
    * * *

    that also maintains nexus over the same activity.  A taxpayer that is  
    subject to an eligible gross receipts tax on the same activity in  
    more than one jurisdiction may be entitled to a deduction as follows:

    due to the other city from the measure of the tax owed to the City.  
  
  
    B.  Person manufacturing products within and without the City.  A  
    person manufacturing products within the City using products  
    manufactured by the same person outside the City may deduct from the

    receipts tax paid to the other jurisdiction with respect to  
    manufacturing such products.  
  
  
    Section 5.  Effective January 1, 2004, Section 5.45.080 of the

    SMC  5.45.080  Persons conducting business both within and without  
    the City.  
  
    Where SMC 5.45.100 Q (pertaining to the allocation of gross  
    income between jurisdictions that impose an eligible gross receipts  
    tax) does not apply: This section instructs taxpayers which  
    revenues will be assigned to the City as taxable.  Once the amount  
    subject to tax in Seattle is determined according to this section,  
    then the credit or deductions contained in 5.45.070 and 5.45.075 may  
    be calculated, if applicable.  
  
    A.  A person who maintains an office or place of business in the City  
    shall be taxable on the gross income, gross proceeds from  
    of sales, or value of products, that is derived from  
    the business activities rendered by, generated from, or attributable  
    to the office or place of business located within the City, unless  
    specific deductions or exemptions apply.  
  
    B.  A person who maintains an office or place of business in the  
    City and also elsewhere may allocate to the office or place of  
    business located outside the City that portion of the taxpayer's  
    gross income, gross proceeds of sales, or value of products derived  
    from business activities rendered by, generated from, or attributable  
    to the office or place of business located outside the City.  The  
    taxpayer shall allocate gross income to the City based on a  
    segregation of business within and business without the City, as  
    shown and supported by accounting records satisfactory to the  
    Director.  
  
    If the Director determines that the allocation of gross income  
    from business reported under the "other business activities"  
    classification (SMC 5.45.050(F)) does not fairly reflect gross income  
    derived from business activities within the City, the Director shall  
    determine such gross income by either of the following methods: (a)  
    by a fair and equitable formula agreed upon by the Director and the  
    taxpayer after a consideration of the facts; or (b) by the ratio that  
    the cost of doing business within the City bears to the cost of doing  
    business both within and without the City  
  
       A person engaging in business activities in the City who does  
    not maintain an office or place of business in the City shall  
    allocate to the City that portion of the taxpayer's gross income or  
    gross proceeds of sales that are derived from business activities  
    performed in the City.  
  
    C.  A person performing business activities in the City who does  
    not maintain an office or place of business in the City shall  
    allocate to the City that portion of the taxpayer's gross income or  
    gross proceeds of sales that is derived from business activities  
    performed in the City  
  
       A person who maintains an office or place of business in the  
    City and also elsewhere  
  
      1) shall be taxable on that portion of his gross income or gross  
    proceeds of sales, or value of products that is derived from  
    business activity rendered by, generated from, or attributable to   
    the office or place of business located within the City, unless  
    specific deductions or exemptions apply;  and  
  
      2)  shall allocate to the City and be taxable on gross income,  or  
    gross proceeds of sales, from business activities performed in the  
    City but supported by the office or place of business located outside  
    the City, where the business activity performed in the City is a  
    significant factor in making or holding the market for the goods  
    or services sold, and  
  
      (a) delivery of product or the performance of services occurs in  
    Seattle; or  
  
  
      (b) the customer is located in Seattle.  
  
  
    Allocations of amounts under this Section shall be made in accordance  
    with and in full compliance with the provisions of the interstate  
    commerce clause of the United States Constitution where applicable  
    .  
  
    D.   If the Director determines that the allocation of gross  
    income from business activities for a person subject to subsection C  
    above and taxable under the "other business activities"  
    classification (SMC 5.45.050 G) does not fairly reflect gross income  
    derived from business activities within the City, the Director shall  
    determine such gross income by either of the following methods: (a)  
    by a fair and equitable formula agreed upon by the Director and the  
    taxpayer after a consideration of the facts; or (b) by the ratio that  
    the cost of doing business within the City bears to the cost of doing  
    business both within and without the City.  For apportionment  
    purposes, all costs must be assigned to an office location.  
  
    E.   This section does not apply to allocate gross income of motor  
    carriers included in the measure of the tax pursuant to subsection  
    5.45.050 F of the Seattle Municipal Code.  This section may apply to  
    allocate gross receipts of motor carriers included in the measure of  
    the tax pursuant to any other subsection of SMC 5.45.050.  
  
  
      Section 6.  Effective January 1, 2004, a new section 5.45.082 is  
    added to Chapter 5.45 of the Seattle Municipal Code as follows.  
  
    SMC  5.45.082  Ancillary activities of motor carriers and freight  
    brokers.  
  
    A.  Ancillary activities of motor carriers include but are not  
    limited to stevedoring, separately billed charges for loading,  
    unloading, sorting, storage, consolidation charges, and other charges  
    not representing the actual transportation charge.  The charges for  
    ancillary activities shall be recorded separately from the  
    transportation charges and reported under the "other business  
    activity" classification (Section 5.45.050 G).  
  
  
    B.  Freight brokers should report revenue from brokering activities  
    under the "other business activity" classification (Section 5.45.050  
    G).  
  
  
    C.  Gross receipts from the activities contained in Section 5.45.082  
    A & B above are subject to the apportionment provisions contained in  
    5.45.080.  
  
  
    Section 7.  Effective January 1, 2004, Section 5.45.090 of the  
    Seattle Municipal Code is amended by amending subsections D, N, S,  
    and Z, and adding a new subsection BB, as follows.

    or provide guarantees for student loans.  This chapter does not apply  
    to gross income received by non-profit organizations exempt from

    an agent as defined in RCW 48.17.010; provided that the provisions  
    of this subsection shall not exempt any person engaging in the  
    business of insurance as a broker as defined in RCW 48.17.020 or as a  
    solicitor as defined in RCW 48.17.030; and provided further that the

    from tax with respect to gross income derived from the completion of  
    any contract as to which it is a surety, or as to any liability as  
    successor to the liability of the defaulting contractor.  
  
    * * *  
  
    S.  Employees.  This chapter shall not apply to any person in respect  
    to his or her employment in the capacity as an employee or servant as  
    distinguished from that of an independent contractor.  For the  
    purposes of this subsection, SMC 5.45.090 (S), the definition of

    3121(d)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as   
    hereafter amended through January 1, 1991.  For purposes

    "Sale at wholesale" or "wholesale sale" means any "retail sale,"  
    as defined herein, to a person, other than a consumer, for the  
    purpose of resale sale of tangible personal property which is  
    not a retail sale, and any charge made for labor and services

    canned software does not change the underlying character or  
    taxability of the original canned software.  
  
      4.  "Master copies" of software means copies of software from which  
    a software developer, author, inventor, publisher, licensor,

    software resides are both ingredients of the master copy.  
  
      5.  "Retained rights" means any and all rights, including  
    intellectual property rights such as those rights arising from  
    copyrights, patents, and trade secret laws, that are owned or are

    equipment, or any combination thereof, to perform a task or set of  
    tasks.  "Software" includes the associated documentation, materials,  
    or ingredients regardless of the media upon which that documentation  
    is provided, that describes the code and its use, operation, and  
    maintenance and that typically is delivered with the code to the  
    consumer.  All software is classified as either canned or custom.  
  
    E. "Solid waste" has the meaning given in SMC Section 21.36.016.  
  
    F. "Successor" means any person to whom a taxpayer quitting, selling  
    out, exchanging or disposing of a business sells or otherwise  
    conveys, directly or indirectly, in bulk and not in the ordinary  
    course of the taxpayer's business, any part of the materials,  
    supplies, merchandise, inventory, fixtures or equipment of the  
    taxpayer. Any person obligated to fulfill the terms of a contract  
    shall be deemed a successor to any contractor defaulting in the  
    performance of any contract as to which such person is a surety or  
    guarantor.

    of such institution.  "Educational institution," as used in this  
    section, means only those institutions created or generally  
    accredited as such by the state and includes educational programs  
    that such educational institution cosponsors with a non-profit  
    organization, as defined by Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue  
    Code of 1986, as hereafter amended, if such

    approved branch campus of a foreign degree-granting institution in  
    compliance with chapter 28B.90 RCW, and in accordance with RCW

    institutions.  
  
    F.  "Value proceeding or accruing" means the consideration, whether  
    money, credits, rights, or other property expressed in terms of  
    money, actually received or accrued.  The term shall be applied, in  
    each case, on a cash receipts or accrual basis according to which  
    method of accounting is regularly employed in keeping the books of  
    the taxpayer.  The Director may provide by regulation that the  
     value proceeding or accruing from sales on the installment plan  
    under conditional contracts of sale may shall be  
    reported as of the dates when the payments become due.  
  
    * * *  
  
      Section 17.   Effective January 1, 2004, Section 5.55.040 of the  
    Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:  
  
    SMC  5.55.040  When due and payable - Reporting periods - Monthly,  
    quarterly, and annual returns - Threshold provisions - Computing time  
    periods - Failure to file returns.  
  
    A.  Other than any annual license fee or registration fee assessed  
    under this chapter, the tax imposed by SMC Chapters 5.32 (Amusement  
    Devices), 5.40 (Admission Taxes), 5.45 (Business and Occupation  
     License Tax), 5.48 (Utility Tax), and 5.52 (Gambling Tax),  
    shall be due and payable in quarterly installments.  At the  
    Director's discretion, businesses may be assigned to a monthly or  
    annual reporting period depending on the tax amount owing or type of  
    tax.  Taxes imposed by SMC Section 5.52.030(A)(2) and (B)(2) for  
    punchboards and pulltabs shall be due and payable in monthly  
    installments.  Tax payments are due on or before the last day of the  
    next month following the end of the assigned reporting period covered  
    by the return.  
  
    B.  Taxes shall be paid as provided in this chapter and accompanied  
    by a return on forms as prescribed by the Director.  The return shall  
    be signed by the taxpayer personally or by a responsible officer or  
    agent of the taxpayer.  The individual signing the return shall swear  
    or affirm that the information in the return is true and complete.  
  
    C.  Tax returns must be filed and returned by the due date whether or  
    not any tax is owed. Returns not received on or before the due date  
    are subject to penalties and interest in accordance with this  
    chapter.  
  
    D.  1.  For purposes of the tax imposed by SMC Chapter 5.45,  
    any person whose value of products, gross proceeds of sales, or  
    gross income of the business, subject to tax after all allowable  
    deductions, is less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) in the  
    current calendar year, shall file a return, declare no tax due on  
    their return, and submit the return to the Director.  The gross  
    receipts and deduction amounts shall be entered on the tax return  
    even though no tax may be due.  
  
    2.  Any person who reasonably estimates that the value of  
    products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of the business,  
    as the case may be, subject to tax after all allowable deductions,  
    will be less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) in the current  
    calendar year may file a declaration so stating on a form supplied by  
    the Director at the same time he or she files his or her application  
    for a business license or a renewal.  The Director may assign any  
    person who files such declaration to an annual reporting basis.    
    Regardless of reporting period assigned, any person whose value of  
    products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of the business,  
    subject to tax after all allowable deductions, does not exceed the  
    threshold amount in the current calendar year, shall file a return,  
    declare no tax due on their return, and submit the return to the  
    Director.  The gross receipts and deduction amounts shall be entered  
    on the tax return even though no tax may be due.  
  
    E.  A taxpayer who commences to engage in business activity shall  
    file a return and pay the tax or fee for the portion of the reporting  
    period during which he or she is engaged in business activity subject  
    to the conditions set forth in subsection D, above.  
  
    F.  Except as otherwise specifically provided by any other provision  
    of this chapter, in computing any period of days prescribed by this  
    chapter the day of the act or event from which the designated period  
    of time runs shall not be included.  The last day of the period shall  
    be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or City or Federal  
    legal holiday, in which case the last day of such period shall be the  
    next succeeding day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, or City  
    or Federal legal holiday.  
  
    G.  If any taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to make his or her  
    return as and when required in this chapter, the Director is  
    authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by  
    obtaining facts and information upon which to base his or her  
    estimate of the tax or fees due.  Such assessment shall be deemed  
    prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owed to the City  
    by the taxpayer.  The Director shall notify the taxpayer by mail of  
    the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest,  
    and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become  
    immediately due and payable.  
  
    Section 18.  Effective January 1, 2004, Section 5.55.060 of the

    preserve, for a period of five (5) years after filing a tax return,  
    such records as may be necessary to determine the amount of any fee  
    or tax for which the person may be liable; which records shall  
    include copies of all federal income tax and state tax returns and  
    reports made by the person.  All places of business, books,  
    records, papers, invoices, ticket stubs, vendor lists, gambling games  
    and payout information, inventories, stocks of merchandise, and other  
    data, including federal income tax and state tax returns, and reports  
    needed to determine the accuracy of any taxes due, shall be open for  
    inspection or examination at any time by the Director or a duly  
    authorized agent.  Every person's business premises shall be open  
    for inspection or examination by the Director or a duly authorized  
    agent.  
  
    B.  If a person does not keep the necessary books and records  
    within the City, it shall be sufficient if such person:  
  
      1.  produces within the City such books and records as may be  
    required by the Director, or  
  
      2.  bears the cost of examination by the Director's agent at the  
    place where such books and records are kept; provided that the person  
    electing to bear such cost shall pay in advance to the Director the  
    estimated amount thereof including round-trip fare, lodging, meals  
    and incidental expenses, subject to adjustment upon completion of the  
    examination.  
  
    C.  1.  The Director and Department employees that have been  
    commissioned as special police officers pursuant to Section 5.55.225  
    shall have the right to enter any premises or establishment at  
    reasonable times in order to determine whether a violation  
    constituting a gross misdemeanor under Section 5.55.220 has occurred,  
    is occurring or may occur.  
  
      2.  If the Director or his agent is denied access to any  
    premises or establishment, the Director or his agent may apply for a  
    search warrant to any court official of a court of competent  
    jurisdiction authorized to issue a criminal search warrant.  A search  
    warrant may be issued for the purposes of inspecting or examining  
    property, buildings, premises, places, books, records, or other  
    physical evidence in order to determine compliance with law and rules  
    administered by the Department.  The warrant shall be issued upon  
    probable cause.  
  
    D.  Any person who fails, or refuses a Department request, to  
    provide or make available records, or to allow inspection or  
    examination of the business premises information contained in  
    subsection A, shall be forever barred from questioning in any  
    court action, the correctness of any assessment of taxes made by the  
    City based upon any period for which such books,  
    records, and invoices have not been provided, made  
    available orso kept and preserved, or in respect to  
    which inspection or examination of the business premises has been  
    denied.  The Director is authorized to determine the amount of the  
    tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to  
    base the estimate of the tax or fees due.  Such fee or tax assessment  
    shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax  
    owing the City by the taxpayer. The Director shall notify the  
    taxpayer by mail of the amount of tax so determined, together with  
    any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall  
    thereupon become immediately due and payable.  
  
    Section 19.  Effective January 1, 2004, Section 5.55.090 of the  
    Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows.  
  
    SMC  5.55.090  Underpayment of tax, interest, or penalty -   
     Interest on underpayment of tax  - Limitations.  
  
    A.  If, upon examination of any returns, or from other information  
    obtained by the Director, it appears that an amount of tax less than  
    that properly due has been paid, the Director shall add interest  
    thereto as provided in subsection B of this section.  Interest shall  
    be added to delinquent tax only and shall not be calculated upon  
    penalty or interest.    
  
    B.  Interest calculations on underpayments:  
  
      1.  Interest on underpayments of taxes for periods prior to   
    the effective date of Ordinance 120668January 1, 2002  
    shall be computed from the date of underpayment until paid at a rate  
    of ten (10) percent per year on the balance due.  
  
      2.  Interest on underpayments of taxes for periods beginning on or  
    after the effective date of Ordinance 120668January 1,  
    2002 shall be computed from the last day of the month following  
    the end of the reporting period and will continue to accrue until  
    payment is made.  In case of a deficiency assessment the interest  
    shall be computed from the first day of the month following each  
    calendar year or portion thereof included in the assessment  
    audit period.  The rate of interest to be charged to the  
    taxpayer shall be an average of the federal short-term rate as  
    defined in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 1274(d) plus two (2) percentage points.  
    The rate set for each new year shall be computed by taking an  
    arithmetical average to the nearest percentage point of the federal  
    short-term rate, compounded annually, for the months of January,  
    April, July, and October of the year immediately preceding the  
    calendar year as published by the United States Secretary of the  
    Treasury.  That average shall be calculated using the rates  
    from four months: January, April, and July of the calendar year  
    immediately preceding the new year, and October of the previous  
    preceding year.  The rate shall be adjusted on the first day  
    of January of each year for use in computing interest for that  
    calendar year.

    limitations, for taxes due within the period authorized by the  
    waiver.  
  
    B.  The Director shall notify the person by mail of the amount of the  
    deficiency, which shall become due and shall be paid within thirty  
    (30) days from the date of the notice, or within such additional

    is in excess of that properly due, the excess amount shall be  
    credited to the taxpayer's account or shall be refunded to the  
    taxpayer. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, no  
    refund or credit shall be made for taxes, penalties, or interest   
    accrued and paid more than four (4) years prior to the beginning

    B.  The execution of a written waiver, pursuant to SMC 5.55.095,  
    shall extend the time for applying for, or making, a refund or credit  
    of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by  
    the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an  
    application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the  
    Director discovers that a refund or credit is due.  
  
    C.  Refunds shall be made by means of vouchers approved by the

    3. 2.  Interest on overpayments of taxes for periods  
    beginning on or after January 1, 2002, shall be the average

    disclosure would compromise any investigation or litigation by any  
    federal, state, or local government agency in connection with the

    that such disclosure would identify a confidential informant, or that  
    such disclosure is contrary to any agreement entered into by the  
    Director that provides for the reciprocal exchange of information  
    with other government agencies which agreement requires  
    confidentiality with respect to such information unless such  
    information is required to be disclosed to the taxpayer by the order  
    of any court.  
  
    D.  Nothing in this section shall prevent the use of tax information  
    by the Director or any other agency in any civil or criminal action

    SMC  5.55.215  Civil penalty.  
  
    A.  In addition to any other sanction or remedial procedure which may  
    be available, any person who:  
  
  
    (1) violates or fails to comply with any requirements of Sections  
    5.52.020, 5.40.080, or 5.55.030; or  
  
    (2) fails to make and transmit a return for taxes as required  
    under Section 5.55.040;  
  
    shall be subject to a penalty in the amount of One Hundred Fifty  
    Dollars ($150.00) for each such violation.  If, after fifteen days of  
    having been properly served with a First Notice of Violation from the  
    Director, the person fails to comply with the requirements of the  
    provisions set forth above, the penalty shall be increased to Three  
    Hundred Dollars ($300.00) for each such violation.  
  
  
    B.  After discovery of the existence of a violation or the failure to  
    comply with Section 5.55.030 or the failure to file a tax return as  
    required by Section 5.55.040, the Director shall issue a First Notice  
    of Violation in the manner set forth in Section 5.55.216, which  
    notice shall impose the civil penalty and notify the person of the  
    date by which the person must be in compliance to avoid additional  
    penalty.   If, after fifteen days of having been properly served with  
    the First Notice of Violation from the Director, the person fails to  
    comply with the requirements of the provisions set forth above, the  
    Director shall issue a Second Notice of Violation which notice shall

    action brought by the Director in the name of the City. In any civil  
    action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a  
    preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the  
    issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review  
    by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.  
  
  
      Section 28. Effective January 1, 2004, a new Section 5.55.216  
    shall be added to the Seattle Municipal Code, as follows:

    5.55.030, or has failed to file a tax return as required under  
    Section 5.55.040, the Director shall serve a First Notice Of  
    Violation upon the person. The First Notice Of Violation shall state  
    separately each requirement violated, shall state the civil penalty  
    to which the person is subject, shall state what corrective action,  
    if any, is necessary to comply with the requirements; and shall set a  
    time for compliance as set forth in Section 5.55.215. The notice  
    shall state that any continuing violation may result in additional  
    penalty as provided by Section 5.55.215, and shall state that any  
    continuing violation may result in criminal prosecution as provided  
    in Section 5.55.220.  
  
  
    B.  If, after fifteen days of having been properly served with the  
    First Notice of Violation from the Director, the person fails to  
    comply with the requirements of the provisions set forth above, the  
    Director shall issue a Second Notice of Violation. The notice shall  
    state the additional penalty imposed and shall state that any  
    continuing violation may result in criminal prosecution as provided  
    in Section 5.55.220.  
  
  
    C.  All notices under this section shall be served by personal  
    service, registered mail, or certified mail with return receipt  
    requested, addressed to the last known address of such person. If,  
    after a reasonable search and reasonable efforts are made to obtain  
    service, the whereabouts of the person or persons is unknown or  
    service cannot be accomplished and the Director makes an affidavit to  
    that effect, then service of the notice upon such person or persons  
    may be made by:  
  
  
    1. Publishing the notice once each week for two (2) consecutive weeks  
    in the City Official Newspaper; and  
  
  
    2. Mailing a copy of the notice to each person named on the notice of  
    violation by first  
  
  
    class mail to the last known address if known, or if unknown, to the  
    address of the property involved in the proceedings.  
  
  
    A copy of the notice may be posted at a conspicuous place on the  
    property, unless posting the notice is not physically possible.  
  
  
    D.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit or preclude any  
    action or proceeding pursuant to Section 5.55.220.  
  
  
    E.  An Order or Notice may be amended at any time in order to:  
  
  
    1. Correct clerical errors, or  
  
  
    2. Cite additional authority for a stated violation.
