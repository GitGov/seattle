     This AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated this _______ day of  
    _____________, 200___, is made by and between the Seattle Popular  
    Monorail Authority (commonly known as the Seattle Monorail Project),  
    and the City of Seattle (the "City") (collectively, the "Parties"),  
    two separate and legally independent local governments.  
  
    I.  RECITALS  
  
    BACKGROUND  
  
    A. In 1997, the voters in the City passed Initiative 41, establishing  
    the Elevated Transportation Company ("ETC"), which was to study and  
    make recommendations for the construction of a significantly expanded  
    monorail mass transit system in the City.  
  
    B. In 2000, voters in the City passed Initiative 53/Proposition 2,  
    which provided City funding for the ETC to prepare a proposal to be  
    submitted to the voters, allowing the voters to decide whether to  
    establish an authority with the power to raise public funds to plan,  
    finance, build, acquire, complete, operate, charge for, and maintain  
    an expanded monorail system.  
  
    C. Initiative 53/Proposition 2 further states that the City, its  
    entities and employees shall include monorail options in any Strategic  
    Transportation Initiative ("STI") process or similar study or process,  
    and that the City must facilitate that measure in any way needed,  
    including but not limited to prioritizing obtaining any permits, or  
    dedication or use of any rights-of-way, or any waivers or changes in  
    any state or other superior law that may be needed.  
  
    D. In 2002, the Washington State Legislature enacted 2002 Washington  
    Laws, ch. 248 to allow voters to create a "city transportation  
    authority," a municipal corporation that would have the power to plan,  
    construct, and operate a monorail transportation system, thereby  
    creating a mechanism for implementation of the goals and objectives of  
    Initiative 53.  
  
    E. In April 2002, the Seattle City Council ("City Council") adopted,  
    and the Mayor signed, Resolution 30448, which states that the City  
    intends to negotiate an agreement with a future monorail authority, if  
    one is created, to allow that authority the use of the City right-of-  
    way, and further that the City will not charge a fee for ongoing use  
    of the City right-of-way, but that if the right-of-way needs to be  
    expanded, the City and the authority will negotiate costs.  
  
    F. In July 2002, the City Council adopted, and the Mayor signed,  
    Resolution 30486 which states, among other things, that "the City  
    intends to facilitate fast, coordinated, cost-effective construction  
    of a Seattle monorail system, and to meet the intent of Initiative 53,  
    by negotiating, entering into and implementing agreements addressing  
    right-of-way use, use of the West Seattle Bridge, expedited review and  
    approvals, utility relocation and coordination, [and] the existing  
    Seattle Center Monorail System...."  
  
    G. Resolution 30486 further states that the "City intends to provide a  
    system for expedited review of monorail project permit applications  
    resulting in decisions on a predictable, timely and cost-effective  
    schedule.  The City intends that this system will allow a phased or  
    rolling schedule for construction permitting that is compatible with  
    and cost-effective for state-of-the-art monorail construction  
    practices.  The City intends to work cooperatively with the new  
    monorail authority toward a mutual goal of a 30-day turnaround time  
    for construction permits.  The City also intends to coordinate permit  
    review for monorail structures with private development proposals that  
    are desirably integrated with monorail development.  The City intends  
    to establish clear lines of authority to coordinate among all City  
    departments and between the new monorail authority and the City.  
    Recognizing that the cost estimate developed for the Draft [Seattle  
    Popular Transit Plan] includes funding for City staff dedicated to the  
    project, the City anticipates that the new monorail authority will  
    provide funding to support the City's expedited permitting effort."  
  
    H. Resolution 30486 further states that it is "the policy intent of  
    the City to support monorail cost containment by limiting project  
    requirements to those elements that are necessary for the safe and  
    effective operation of the monorail, and necessary to directly  
    mitigate any significant adverse impacts that may be caused by the  
    monorail project as identified in a final, project-level environmental  
    impact statement.  These elements may include improvements adjacent to  
    but outside the perimeter of the monorail system itself that are  
    integral to making the monorail a well-functioning part of the overall  
    transportation system and the urban environment.  The City does intend  
    to not require any extraneous or extraordinary investments in  
    neighborhood or community development to be funded by the new monorail  
    authority."  
  
    I. Resolution 30486 further states:  "The City intends to negotiate an  
    agreement with the future monorail authority that would recognize the  
    system as a public transportation improvement and would address  
    responsibility for the cost of relocation of utilities necessitated by  
    monorail construction. Recognizing that the cost estimate developed  
    for the Draft SPTP includes funding for relocation of only City-owned  
    utilities, the City anticipates that the new monorail authority will  
    fund these relocation costs."  
  
    J. In July 2002, the City Council adopted, and the Mayor signed,  
    Resolution 30485, through which the City urges the future monorail  
    authority to observe certain design principles, both during  
    construction and throughout the life of the monorail facility.  Those  
    principles include, but are not limited to:  (1) "minimize the visual  
    impacts and maximize benefits to neighborhoods, paying particular  
    attention to minimizing the visual impacts of guideways and stations  
    at the street level and on pedestrians";  (2) "ensure that stations  
    enhance the community fabric and are a positive force in strengthening  
    economic vitality and creating a strong pedestrian environment";  (3)  
    "[c]onsideration for ground-level design and landscaping should be  
    included in the monorail plan and cost estimates";  (4) "recognize and  
    respect historic resources, and work collaboratively with the State  
    Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation and the Seattle  
    Department of Neighborhoods (including relevant historic and district  
    review boards, such as the Landmarks Preservation Board and the  
    Pioneer Square Preservation Board) to develop a plan for dealing with  
    system impacts on historic resources, and ensure that adequate funds  
    are budgeted to implement that plan"; and (5) "develop a plan for  
    dealing with community impacts of monorail construction and operation,  
    and ensure that adequate funds are budgeted to implement that plan."  
  
    K. In August 2002, the ETC adopted the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan,  
    the plan for a citywide system.  The ETC also prepared a "plan-level"  
    environmental impact statement, pursuant to the State Environmental  
    Policy Act ("SEPA"), supporting the adoption of Seattle Popular  
    Monorail Plan.  
  
    L. On November 5, 2002, Seattle voters passed Seattle Citizen Petition  
    No. 1, creating the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority, now commonly  
    known as the Seattle Monorail Project ("SMP"), and approving local  
    funding for implementation of Phase I of the Seattle Popular Monorail  
    Plan.  Seattle Citizen Petition No. 1, as approved by the voters,  
    finds that the "City shall use its best efforts, consistent with the  
    best interests of the City, to support implementation of this  
    Proposition, including through the City's cooperation with the  
    [Seattle Monorail Project] consistent with City Resolution 30486."  
  
    M. By virtue of the vote on November 5, 2002, the SMP is a duly  
    organized city transportation authority existing under 2002 Washington  
    Laws, ch. 248.  
  
    PURPOSE OF THE AGREEMENT  
  
    N. This Agreement relates to development within the boundaries of the  
    City of Seattle of the Green Line, as that Line is described in the  
    Seattle Popular Monorail Plan and will be further defined by the SMP.  
    For purposes of this Agreement, Green Line development will be  
    referred to as the "Project."  The Project includes, among other  
    things, monorail guideway structures, bridge structures and structural  
    retrofit improvements, and monorail stations together with any  
    ancillary facilities, such as transit patron parking, passenger drop-  
    off zones, monorail-related traffic signal and street lighting  
    modifications and synchronization, and bus, auto, bicycle and  
    pedestrian access facilities associated with the Green Line.  In  
    support of the Project, the SMP will undertake and be responsible for  
    a "project-specific" environmental review pursuant to SEPA, and will  
    also work with federal agencies to complete review under the National  
    Environmental Policy Act (" NEPA").  
  
    O. The City of Seattle holds City streets and rights-of-way in trust  
    for the convenience of public travel and is responsible for managing  
    streets within its jurisdiction and administering certain state and  
    local transportation and land use laws and development regulations  
    that will apply to the development of the Project.  The City is also  
    responsible for managing municipal utilities within its jurisdiction  
    and for providing certain other municipal services.  
  
    P. The City and the SMP recognize that the Project is an essential  
    public facility within the meaning of the state Growth Management Act  
    and that the timely and cost-effective construction of the Green Line  
    may require some changes to regional and local transportation plans  
    and City development regulations so that they incorporate the Project.  
  
    Q.  Through its Comprehensive Plan, the City has stated a policy to  
    encourage and increase transit use, especially along the City's  
    Transit Priority Network, which includes the route for the Green Line.  
    The Green Line, by linking the Downtown and Uptown Queen Anne urban  
    centers, Ballard, Crown Hill, West Seattle Junction, and Morgan  
    Junction urban villages and Ballard Interbay North End and Duwamish  
    manufacturing/industrial centers will support the City's policy to  
    provide transit services enabling urban centers and urban villages to  
    reach growth targets in a manner that minimizes single-occupancy  
    vehicle travel.  
  
    R.  The Parties recognize that they have the following objectives:  
  
    * An objective of SMP to develop an accessible public monorail  
    transportation system that effectively provides transportation to the  
    public consistent with service goals and within the budget and  
    schedule adopted in the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan and in  
    subsequent implementation documents, and an objective of the City to  
    integrate that system into the City's transportation system and urban  
    environment and include within that system, but not necessarily limit  
    it to, adequate park and ride capacity (where appropriate and  
    consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan), bus transfer  
    facilities, and bicycle/pedestrian access.  
  
    * Expedited review by the City of necessary permits and approvals in  
    support of an expedited timeline for Project development.  
  
    * As set forth in this Agreement, payment by the SMP to the City for  
    the City's non-regulatory functions and services provided in  
    connection with the Project, which payment is best structured through  
    a flat-fee arrangement to enable the City to timely muster the  
    necessary staff and resources and to relieve the City from having to  
    undertake the complicated and costly effort of tracking and billing  
    for specific cost items.  
  
    * Provision by the SMP of reasonable mitigation for adverse  
    environmental impacts that meets the policy intent stated in  
    Resolution 30486 and complies with applicable law.  
  
    * Preparation by the SMP of environmental documents that meet the  
    requirements of SEPA and NEPA and are adequate to meet the decision-  
    making needs of the SMP, the City, and other affected agencies,  
    consistent with all applicable legal requirements.  
  
    * Involvement of the community throughout the design and environmental  
    review process, including during environmental review and Project  
    siting decisions and at key stages during design.  
  
    * Recognition of the importance of quick, appropriate, inclusive, and  
    final decisions that enable the SMP to maintain the Project's budget  
    and schedule.  
  
    * Prompt provision by the City of certainty and closure regarding  
    mitigation measures, SEPA conditions, design standards and regulatory  
    approvals, which the Parties believe are of the highest importance to  
    SMP's ability to conclude the Project within budget and within the  
    schedule adopted in the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan.  The Parties  
    recognize that a development agreement under RCW 36.70B.170 - .210 is  
    one means to provide that certainty.  
  
    * Building effective, ongoing intergovernmental cooperation between  
    the Parties.  
  
    S.  The Parties agree that these objectives can most effectively be  
    accomplished through a team approach to carrying out their respective  
    roles.  The Parties intend to cooperate in a coordinated and expedited  
    effort, which is expressed through this Agreement and will be further  
    expressed through such additional agreements as may be needed.  For  
    the mutual benefit of the Parties, the City has already provided a  
    line of credit to enable the SMP to commence its capital activities  
    expeditiously at no cost to the City.  As reflected in this Agreement,  
    the Parties recognize the need for cooperation to expedite  
    environmental review, permit review, design development and  
    construction of a monorail system that furthers the Parties'  
    transportation objectives.  
  
    In consideration of the covenants and assurances set forth below, it  
    is mutually agreed as follows:  
  
    II.  INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION  
  
    A.  Designated Representatives  
  
    To ensure effective intergovernmental cooperation and efficient  
    Project review, the SMP and the City will each designate a  
    representative (the "Designated Representative").  Although each  
    Designated Representative is ultimately responsible for carrying out  
    the responsibilities assigned to him or her through this Agreement,  
    nothing in this Agreement precludes a Designated Representative from  
    delegating duties to others within his or her organization as the  
    Designated Representative deems appropriate.  The Designated  
    Representatives are identified in Attachment A.  Either Party may  
    change its Designated Representative through written notice to the  
    other Party's Designated Representative.  
  
    B.  Coordination and Communication  
  
    Each Designated Representative is responsible for carrying out his or  
    her Party's respective roles undertaken through this Agreement and  
    working toward the schedule objectives and target dates stated in  
    Section VI.  The Designated Representatives are also responsible for  
    coordinating effective communication between the Parties' respective  
    staff and consultants assigned to the Project.  
  
    Coordinating effective communication between City and SMP staff and  
    consultants includes the resolution of disputes that may arise between  
    departments and/or consultants that report solely to the SMP or to the  
    City, and the development of review schedules that allow for  
    simultaneous review by multiple departments. For example, the City's  
    Designated Representative will be responsible for coordinating  
    decisions on the Project from the various City departments and the  
    Mayor's office.  Similarly, the SMP's Designated Representative will  
    be responsible for coordinating input from the SMP's consultants and  
    subcontractors, working to ensure that the SMP provides timely and  
    complete submittals, and working to ensure that the SMP responds  
    promptly to City requests for additional information.  Project  
    coordination may require the development of further agreements between  
    the SMP and the City.  
  
    C.  City of Seattle Monorail Implementation Team  
  
    The City will form an interdepartmental monorail implementation team  
    ("City Team") to provide timely, reasonable and cost-effective design  
    input and permitting recommendations, and to guide the integration of  
    the Project into the transportation system and the urban environment.  
    The City's Designated Representative will manage the City Team.  
  
    The City's administrative policy, planning, design, and engineering  
    assistance and input to the Project, and the City's administrative  
    regulatory review functions (excluding quasi-judicial review) will be  
    integrated responsibilities of the City Team.  
  
    The City Team will provide: alignment and station-specific planning  
    and input on design development; station area planning; Project  
    architectural and urban design review and analysis; utility  
    coordination; input for purposes of cost estimating; permit  
    application support including proposed code development at the  
    administrative level; review of and comment on the DEIS, the FEIS and  
    other environmental documents; support for identification, evaluation  
    and selection of appropriate mitigation measures that may be included  
    in the DEIS and FEIS; review and processing of street use permit and  
    land use permit applications; and City implementation coordination.  
  
    The City Team will be responsible for developing consensus on issues  
    among City executive departments and providing unified, consistent  
    comments from these departments to the SMP in a timely manner.  The  
    City Team will also be responsible for formulating unified policy  
    recommendations from among these departments, and presenting those  
    recommendations to City decision makers in support of formal City  
    actions, including but not limited to those identified in Section VI.  
  
    D.  SMP Project Development Team  
  
    The SMP will form a Project development team ("SMP Team") that will  
    interact with the City Team to provide for early and frequent  
    consultation on issues related to monorail Project development that  
    involve interaction with the City, such as environmental review,  
    permitting, and utility relocation related to the Project.  
  
    The SMP will provide a reasonable number of workstations, depending  
    upon space availability and Project and City needs, allowing for  
    periodic co-location of City Team staff with SMP Project staff and  
    consultants.  Further, the SMP will pay Project-related out-of-state  
    travel expenses of City Team members, when City Team participation in  
    such Project-related travel is requested by SMP and approved by a City  
    department Director.  By working with the SMP Team, the City can  
    facilitate expedited regulatory and non-regulatory review of the  
    Project.  The City's Designated Representative will be responsible for  
    designating City staff and consultants to interact with the SMP Team  
    and for managing their interaction.  
  
    E.  Project Management Plan;  Phased Permitting and Approvals  
  
    The City and SMP Teams will jointly develop a detailed Project  
    management plan that identifies key policy, planning and regulatory  
    issues and identifies the tasks and deliverables necessary to achieve  
    timely, reasonable and cost-effective resolution of these issues.  
    This Project management plan will be updated on a regular basis by the  
    Parties as they deem necessary.  
  
    The City will make its best efforts, consistent with the policy intent  
    stated in Resolution 30486 and the best interests of the City, to  
    phase regulatory review and approval processes for the Project in a  
    manner that provides certainty to the SMP at the earliest opportunity.  
  
    F.  Design Review  
  
    The SMP recognizes the City's interest in the quality of Project  
    design and development of the monorail system because of the long-term  
    impact the Project will have on the character of the City.  Components  
    of the Project that are to be constructed on City property and right-  
    of-way are currently subject, among other things, to advisory review  
    by the Seattle Design Commission consistent with the provisions of SMC  
    Chapter 3.58 and SMC 22.900D.170.E.  Components of the Project that  
    are within the Shoreline District may be subject to design review  
    consistent with the provisions of SMC 23.60.154.  
  
    Recognizing the unique nature of the Project and its broad scope and  
    aggressive schedule objectives, Commission review will be facilitated  
    by the City Team's preparation of architecture and urban design  
    analysis of the Project that will be presented on a regular basis to  
    the Commission and/or any special Commission committee the City may  
    form for review of the Project.  Commission review will also be  
    facilitated by City Team preparation of reports that communicate the  
    Commission's advice to the SMP and/or to City decision makers.  
  
    Consistent with the provisions of SMC 3.58.070, "The Commission shall  
    make its recommendations on any matter submitted to it within thirty  
    (30) days after submission unless an extension is authorized by the  
    City. If it fails to do so, it shall be considered to have recommended  
    approval."  The City's Designated Representative will provide the  
    Commission with a schedule of matters to be submitted to the  
    Commission, which at a minimum will include a proposed Monorail  
    Transit Way (as described in Section IV) and any Master Use Permit  
    applications.  
  
    G.  Historic Preservation  
  
    The SMP shall consult with the City to develop SMP's methodology for  
    ensuring compliance with City SEPA policies that address historic  
    preservation.  In those instances where the monorail traverses a local  
    or National Register historic district, the SMP will comply with  
    applicable historic district regulations.  The SMP will work with the  
    City's Historic Preservation Program in the Department of  
    Neighborhoods to ensure compliance with applicable historic  
    preservation regulations at the local level.  With regard to  
    buildings, sites or objects that have been nominated, but not yet  
    designated, as Seattle landmarks and that are affected by the Project,  
    the SMP shall work with the Historic Preservation Program staff to  
    ensure compliance.  
  
    III.  ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS  
  
    A.  As part of a phased or tiered approach to environmental review,  
    the SMP will evaluate reasonable, project-specific alternative designs  
    and alignments for the Project in the Green Line EIS, consistent with  
    SEPA and the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan.  The SMP will serve as the  
    SEPA lead agency.  The SMP will therefore oversee the preparation of  
    environmental documents that comply with applicable law.  The SMP will  
    also work with federal agencies to complete review under NEPA.  
  
    B.  The SMP will provide opportunities for community and other public  
    input to the environmental review process as required by law.  
  
    C.  The SMP and the City intend to consult with one another to propose  
    and evaluate appropriate mitigation measures, consistent with the  
    policy intent of Resolution 30486 and with SEPA and other applicable  
    law, for the Project elements evaluated in the environmental impact  
    statement.  
  
    D.  To facilitate opportunities for City input, the SMP will provide  
    to the City a copy of the SMP's work plan for screening alternatives,  
    reviewing the impacts of Project alternatives, and development of the  
    DEIS and FEIS and a schedule of environmental review milestones.  
  
    IV.  MONORAIL ALIGNMENT & TRANSIT WAY  
  
    A.  The Parties anticipate that the City will designate City right-of-  
    way for Project use and grant non-exclusive use of said City right-of-  
    way to the SMP to construct, operate, maintain, and own a monorail  
    transit system in the City of Seattle within and along the monorail  
    route.  The Parties anticipate that City approval of one or more  
    monorail transit way agreements will provide approval of a Project  
    alignment and station, maintenance facility and traction power  
    substation locations, subject to additional regulatory actions that  
    may be required by law prior to construction of the Project.  
  
    V.  EXPEDITED PERMIT PROCESSING  
  
    A.  Pre-Application Process  
  
    The Parties' Designated Representatives will schedule pre-application  
    conferences between SMP and City staff to identify the appropriate  
    procedures and review criteria for the Project.  The SMP acknowledges  
    its responsibility for the SMP Team to provide the City Team with  
    relevant and appropriate information as early as possible so that the  
    City may conduct its review in a manner consistent with the policy  
    intent set forth in Resolution 30486.  
  
    B.  Permit Applications  
  
    Appropriate City departments will allow the SMP to submit phased  
    Project permit applications before the completion of environmental  
    review.  The City will notify the SMP of the need for changes or  
    additions to the application(s) as they become apparent through City  
    participation in the Project environmental review, public involvement  
    activities, and design development processes and based on the  
    information available at the time.  The SMP shall ensure that  
    applications (including phased applications) meet adopted City  
    regulatory standards for permit applications and that City requests  
    for corrections and information are addressed in a timely manner.  
  
    The SMP and the City will emphasize the use of parallel processes in  
    their respective roles in Project development.  Appropriate City  
    departments will consider and review Project permit applications,  
    including simultaneous review of a building permit application (or  
    applications) that is submitted with a master use permit application.  
    Building permit review may be phased to allow certain preliminary site  
    work to begin while other design work is still being completed,  
    provided that applicable land use and environmental requirements have  
    been met.  The City and SMP will jointly establish an expeditious  
    strategy for completing land use and building permit review, which  
    strategy will address the following scheduling goals.  More than two  
    correction notices (and responses) may be needed if City departments  
    so determine.  
  
    For Master Use Permits issued by the City's Department of Design,  
    Construction and Land Use ("DCLU"):  
  
    * Pre-submittal conference;  
  
    * Permit intake;

    possible, but no later than 14 days, after receipt of final correction  
    notice;  
  
    * If a final environmental impact statement under SEPA has been issued  
    for the Project, publication of the Master Use Permit decision by DCLU  
    no later than 30 days after DCLU receives SMP's complete responses to  
    a final correction notice (or to a first correction notice if DCLU did  
    not issue a final correction notice), otherwise publication of the  
    decision no later than 30 days after the issuance of the final  
    environmental impact statement under SEPA.  
  
    For construction permits issued by DCLU:  
  
    * Permit intake;  
  
    * First correction notice from DCLU within 30 days of intake;  
  
    * SMP responses to first correction notice as soon as possible after  
    receipt of first correction notice, but no longer than 30 days;  
  
    * Final correction notice (if necessary) from DCLU within 14 days of  
    DCLU receipt of SMP responses to first correction notice;  
  
    * SMP responses to final correction notice as soon as possible after  
    receipt of final correction notice, but no longer than 14 days;  
  
    * If a final environmental impact statement under SEPA has been issued  
    for the Project, permit issuance by DCLU no later than 30 days after  
    DCLU receives SMP's final response to a final correction notice (or  
    after DCLU receives SMP's final response to a first correction notice  
    should a final correction notice not be required), otherwise, if a  
    final environmental impact statement under SEPA is not issued until  
    after DCLU receives SMP's final response to a final correction notice  
    (or after DCLU receives SMP's final response to a first correction  
    notice should a final correction notice not be required), permit  
    issuance no later than 30 days after issuance of the final  
    environmental impact statement under SEPA.  
  
    For all permits issued by the Seattle Transportation Department  
    ("SDOT") for work in the City's rights-of-way:  
  
    * Permit intake;  
  
    * First correction notice from SDOT within 30 days of intake;  
  
    * SMP responses to first correction notice as soon as possible after

    *  If a final environmental impact statement under SEPA has been  
    issued for the Project, permit issuance by SDOT no later than 30 days  
    after SDOT receives SMP's final response to a final correction notice  
    (or after SDOT receives SMP's final response to a first correction  
    notice should a final correction notice not be required), otherwise,  
    if a final environmental impact statement under SEPA is not issued  
    until after SDOT receives SMP's final response to a final correction  
    notice (or after SDOT receives SMP's final response to a first  
    correction notice should a final correction notice not be required),  
    permit issuance no later than 30 days after issuance of the final  
    environmental impact statement under SEPA.  
  
    For all design review recommendations issued by the City's Seattle  
    Design Commission:  
  
    * Public meeting of the Design Commission within 21 days of the  
    submission of the Project component or permit to the Design Commission  
    by DCLU, SDOT or other City department or agency, which submission  
    will include a complete and full presentation of the Project component  
    or permit by the SMP;  
  
    * Pursuant to SMC 3.58.070, advisory recommendation from the Design  
    Commission within 30 days of the submission (unless an extension is  
    authorized by the City).  
  
    For all other permits and approvals, if any, required from the City  
    for the Project, the City will assist SMP to establish an expeditious  
    strategy for completing permit review and decisions on an accelerated  
    schedule consistent with the policy intent of Resolution 30486.  
  
    VI.  SCHEDULE OBJECTIVES & TARGET DATES  
  
    A  The Parties acknowledge the importance to the SMP of completing the  
    Project so that the monorail service may begin by December 15, 2007.  
    Accordingly, the Parties will work in good faith toward the schedule  
    objectives and target dates identified below.  The Parties will  
    establish a more detailed schedule as more information becomes  
    available.  The schedule may include anticipated dates for pre-  
    application permit reviews and anticipated submission dates for permit  
    and other applications.  The Parties further agree that the schedule  
    objectives and target dates identified below may be changed through  
    written agreement of the Designated Representatives.  
  
    Schedule Objective                                                                                Target Date

    Amendments Necessary to Permit Project  
  
    VII.  SMP CONSIDERATION FOR CITY SERVICES  
  
    A. Non-Regulatory Functions and Services.  
  
    The SMP shall pay the City in the amount of Three Million Dollars  
    ($3,000,000), which amount the Parties agree is fair consideration for  
    the non-regulatory City Team functions and services described in  
    Section II.C that will be provided from January 1, 2003 through  
    December 31, 2004, exclusive of utility coordination and review and  
    processing of street use permit and land use permit applications.  The  
    SMP shall, by the last day of each month from January 1, 2003, through  
    December 2004, inclusive, pay to the City one-twenty-fourth of the  
    amount due under this paragraph, with the exception that the first  
    payment shall not be due until forty-five days after execution of the  
    Agreement and shall include all the monthly payments that would  
    otherwise have been due for the period beginning January 1, 2003,  
    through the end of the month in which that first payment is made.  
  
    The Parties anticipate that they will make a subsequent agreement  
    addressing reimbursement for similar City services provided after  
    December 31, 2004.  
  
    As described in Section II.C and II.F, the City Team will provide  
    architectural and urban design review and analysis to support and  
    facilitate advisory review of the Project by the Seattle Design  
    Commission.  Accordingly, the payment provided for in this section  
    shall be in lieu of fees customarily charged for review by the  
    Commission.  
  
    By mutual written consent of the City and SMP Designated  
    Representatives, additional non-regulatory functions not contemplated  
    in this Agreement or functions needed to address significant changes  
    in the scope or schedule of the Project may be provided by the City  
    prior to December 31, 2004.  The City will provide no more than  
    $200,000 worth of additional non-regulatory services, and the SMP will  
    reimburse the City for such services.  The City shall separately  
    invoice any such additional amount and the SMP shall remit payment  
    within thirty days of each invoice date.  
  
    B. Review of Land Use, Street Use, and Related Permit Applications  
  
    The Parties acknowledge that they intend to make a subsequent  
    agreement to provide for expedited review of Master Use Permit,  
    Construction Permit and Street Use Permit applications.  This  
    supplement or supplements will provide the City reimbursement for  
    resources dedicated to permit review for this uniquely expansive,  
    linear project, in lieu of fees for review of land use, street use,  
    and related permit applications customarily charged to reimburse the  
    City for such application review and permitting services for parcel-  
    specific land use projects.  Such an arrangement will benefit the City  
    by allowing it to anticipate and provide resources for regulatory  
    review in a timely manner.  
  
    C. Utility Relocation  
  
    The City recognizes that the Project is a public transportation  
    improvement and, as such, the City will direct conflicting non-City  
    owned utilities to relocate when necessary, at their expense, pursuant  
    to Seattle Municipal Code Section 15.32.120.  SMP agrees that it will  
    coordinate with all utilities to minimize utility relocation costs and  
    related construction, and that SMP will negotiate with non-City owned  
    utilities on utility relocation costs and cost allocation.  
    Notwithstanding any other indemnification language in this Agreement  
    seemingly to the contrary, SMP shall fully indemnify the City for any  
    claim and undertake the defense of any litigation directed at the City  
    arising from the City's attempts to exercise its authority to direct  
    such relocation to accommodate the construction of the Project.  The  
    City shall cooperate fully with SMP in the defense of any such claim.  
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that SMP shall pay  
    for any relocation or protection of City-owned utilities that the City  
    determines is necessary due to construction or operation of the  
    Project.  The specific allocation of costs and logistics (including,  
    without limitation, design and construction) of such relocation or  
    protection shall be defined in a series of future agreements between  
    the City and SMP relating to various construction segments of the  
    Project, each agreement to be entered into before construction on the  
    particular segment begins.  
  
    VIII.  PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT  
  
    A.  The SMP will manage public and community involvement activities at  
    all levels.  The City will not unreasonably withhold its cooperation  
    and participation in that involvement process.  These activities  
    include, but are not limited to:  
  
    -  public meetings, hearings, station area workshops, and design  
    charrettes related to the design alternatives contained in the  
    environmental documents; and  
  
    -  ongoing updates on the progress of the station design, development  
    and construction.  
  
    B.  The SMP will develop a detailed community involvement plan.  The  
    City will have an opportunity to review and comment on the plan as it  
    is developed and modified.  
  
    C.  The City will be responsible for providing public notices,  
    conducting hearings, etc. that the City is otherwise obligated by law  
    to provide or conduct as part of its regulatory review.  But if the  
    City normally charges permit applicants for so doing, the SMP will pay  
    the City according to the City's normal charging practice, and such  
    payments shall be in addition to other amounts to be paid under this  
    Agreement.  
  
    IX.  RECOGNITION OF CITY'S POLICE POWER  
  
    A.  The SMP recognizes the right vested in the City pursuant to law to  
    exercise its police power for the protection of the health, safety,  
    and welfare of its citizens and their properties.  Nothing in this  
    Agreement shall be construed as precluding the City from exercising  
    such power in connection with the SMP's monorail system.  
  
    X.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION  
  
    A.  The Designated Representatives will use their best efforts to  
    resolve disputes and issues arising out of or related to the tasks  
    covered by this Agreement.  The Designated Representatives will  
    communicate regularly to discuss the status of the tasks to be  
    performed and to resolve any issues or disputes related to the  
    successful performance of this Agreement.  The Designated  
    Representatives will cooperate in providing staff support to  
    facilitate the performance of this Agreement and the resolution of any  
    issues or disputes arising during the term of this Agreement.  
  
    B.  Each Designated Representative will notify the other in writing of  
    any problem or dispute that the Designated Representative believes  
    should be resolved.  The Designated Representatives shall meet within  
    three (3) business days of receiving the written notice in an attempt  
    to resolve the dispute.  
  
    C.  In the event the Designated Representatives cannot resolve a  
    dispute (and that dispute is not subject to some other formal appeal  
    or review process), the SMP Executive Director or his/her designee and  
    the Director of Seattle Transportation (or its successor agency) or  
    his/her designee shall meet within seven (7) business days of  
    receiving notice from a Designated Representative and engage in good  
    faith negotiations to resolve the dispute.  
  
    D. SMP and the City agree that they shall have no right to seek relief  
    under this Agreement in a court of law until and unless each of these  
    procedural steps is exhausted.  
  
    E. Nothing in this Agreement shall alter the procedures provided by  
    law for appeals of City land use or other regulatory actions.  
  
    XI. INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE  
  
    A. The SMP, its officers, agents, employees and contractors, shall  
    hold harmless, indemnify and defend at its own expense the City, its  
    officers, agents, employees and contractors, from and against any and  
    all claims, demands, suits, actions, damages, recoveries, judgments,  
    awards, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)  
    related to or arising out of any intentional or negligent act or  
    omission of the SMP under this Agreement; provided, however, that the  
    provisions of this section shall not apply in the event of the sole  
    negligence of the City; and provided further, however, that the  
    provisions of this section shall apply only to the extent of the SMP's  
    negligence in the event of the concurrent negligence of both the SMP  
    and the City.  The SMP acknowledges that the requirements of this  
    section apply to any claims brought by any of its employees or agents.  
    For purposes of this section, the SMP, by mutual negotiation, hereby  
    waives, with respect to the City only, any immunity that would  
    otherwise be available to it with respect to such employee or agent  
    claims under the industrial insurance provisions of Title 51 RCW.  
    This section shall survive the earlier termination of this Agreement.  
  
    B. The City, its officers, agents, employees and contractors, shall  
    hold harmless, indemnify and defend at its own expense the SMP, its  
    officers, agents, employees and contractors, from and against any and  
    all claims, demands, suits, actions, damages, recoveries, judgments,  
    awards, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)  
    related to or arising out of any intentional or negligent act or  
    omission of the City under this Agreement; provided, however, that the  
    provisions of this section shall not apply in the event of the sole  
    negligence of the SMP; and provided further, however, that the  
    provisions of this section shall apply only to the extent of the  
    City's negligence in the event of the concurrent negligence of both  
    the City and the SMP.  The City acknowledges that the requirements of  
    this section apply to any claims brought by any of its employees or  
    agents.  For purposes of this section, the City, by mutual  
    negotiation, hereby waives, with respect to the SMP only, any immunity  
    that would otherwise be available to it with respect to such employee  
    or agent claims under the industrial insurance provisions of Title 51  
    RCW.  This section shall survive the earlier termination of this  
    Agreement.  
  
    C.  Upon the request of either Party, the non-requesting Party shall  
    promptly provide the requesting Party with satisfactory evidence of  
    insurance sufficient to meet such non-requesting Party's  
    indemnification and defense obligations under this Agreement.  
  
    XII.  MISCELLANEOUS  
  
    A.  This Agreement is effective when it is signed by both Parties,  
    after authorization by each Party's respective governing body.  The  
    Parties may amend this Agreement or enter into subsequent agreements,  
    as desired, with the appropriate authorization of each Party.  
  
    B.  This Agreement, including its Recitals and Attachments, embodies  
    the Parties' entire agreement on the specific items covered by it,  
    except as supplemented by subsequent written agreements that the  
    Parties make.  All prior negotiations and draft written agreements are  
    merged into and superseded by this Agreement.  
  
    C.  If any portion of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable by a  
    court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining terms and provisions  
    unaffected thereby will remain in full force and effect.  This  
    Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Washington, and the  
    venue for any actions hereunder shall be the King County Superior
