    A.  General Standards.  
  
    1.  Long-term parking requirements shall be established for all new  
    uses, except as provided in subsection A2.  The long-term requirement  
    shall be determined by the accessibility of the area to transit,

    d.  No parking shall be required for the first two thousand five  
    hundred (2,500) square feet of any nonresidential use or live-work  
    unit that is not a retail sales and service use.  
  
    e.  No parking shall be required when an existing structure is

    h.  In International District Mixed and International District  
    Residential zones, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods,

    picture theaters, and other entertainment uses and places of public  
    assembly shall be established pursuant to the requirements of Section  
    23.66.342, rather than the provisions of this section.  
  
    3.  Location of Required Parking.  
  
    a.  Required parking may be provided on the lot, and/or within eight  
    hundred (800) feet of the lot on which the use is located, and/or  
    within sixteen hundred (1,600) feet of the lot for lots in DH1 zones,  
    provided that:  
  
    (1) The parking is located in a downtown zone in conformance with the  
    accessory parking regulations for that zone; and  
  
    (2) When parking is provided on a lot other than the lot of the use  
    for which it is required, the owner of the parking spaces shall be  
    responsible for notifying the Director should the use of the lot for  
    the required parking cease.  In this event, the principal use must be  
    discontinued, other parking meeting the requirements of this code must  
    be provided within thirty (30) days, or a variance must be applied for  
    within fourteen (14) days, and subsequently granted.  A covenant  
    between the owner of the parking spaces, the owner or operator of the  
    principal use, and The City of Seattle stating the responsibilities of  
    the parties shall be executed.  This covenant and accompanying legal  
    descriptions of the principal use lot and the lot upon which the  
    spaces are to be located shall be recorded with the King County  
    Department of Records and Elections and a copy with the recording  
    number and parking layouts shall be submitted as part of any permit  
    application for development requiring parking.  
  
    b.  In lieu of providing required long-term parking, payment may be  
    made to the Downtown Parking Fund, according to the provisions of  
    subsection B4.  
  
    4.  For the purposes of determining parking requirements, institutions  
    and live-work units shall be considered "other nonresidential"  
    uses on Chart 23.49.016 A. The parking requirements for nonresidential  
    public projects and City facilities shall be determined on a case-by-  
    case basis.  
  
    B.  Parking Requirements.  
  
    1.  The long-term and short-term parking requirement for offices,  
    retail sales and service uses, and other nonresidential uses shall be  
    as established on Chart 23.49.016 A.  The unrestricted long-term  
    parking requirement for all uses except lodging uses may be reduced by  
    providing additional carpool spaces, vanpools, or subsidized transit  
    passes, according to subsection B3.  
  
    2.  Carpool spaces provided to meet the requirements of subsection B1  
    shall either be:  
  
    a.  Physically set aside and designated for exclusive carpool use  
    between six (6:00) a.m. and nine-thirty (9:30) a.m., and shall not be  
    leased to tenants for long-term parking, except as parking for  
    carpools and vanpools. Required carpool spaces not used by carpool  
    vehicles by nine-thirty (9:30) a.m. shall be used as public short-term  
    parking with appropriate signage provided; or  
  
    b.  Subsidized, provided that the subsidy shall be equal to at least  
    thirty (30) percent of the monthly market rate charged the general  
    public for a parking space. Subsidized spaces shall be provided at the  
    rate that carpools are formed.  
  
    3.  The following substitution rates shall be used to reduce the long-  
    term parking requirement for all nonresidential and live-work  
    uses, except lodging uses:  
  
    a.  One (1) vanpool may be substituted for six (6) parking spaces. The  
    unrestricted long-term parking requirement may be reduced not more  
    than ten (10) percent for vanpool substitutions.  If the proponent  
    elects to use the vanpool option, the necessary number of vans meeting  
    the standards of the Commuter Pool Division of Metro shall be  
    acquired, or a surety instrument acceptable to the Director shall be  
    posted; and, vanpools shall be organized for employees in the  
    structure.  Before a certificate of occupancy may be issued, details  
    of the vanpool program shall be spelled out in a Memorandum of  
    Agreement executed between the proponent, his or her transportation  
    coordinator, the Director and the Seattle Rideshare office.  
  
    b.  Each carpool space in excess of those required by subsection B1,  
    which is physically reserved or subsidized according to the provisions  
    of subsection B2, may be substituted for one and nine-tenths (1.9)  
    parking spaces.  No more than fifty (50) percent of the total number  
    of long-term parking spaces provided shall be set aside or discounted  
    for carpools.  
  
    c.  A fifteen (15) percent reduction in the unrestricted long-term  
    parking requirement may be achieved by providing free transit passes  
    to all employees in the structure for at least five (5) years.  
  
    4.  In lieu of providing long-term parking spaces on the lot or within  
    eight hundred (800) feet of the lot, long-term spaces may be provided  
    by a payment to the Downtown Parking Fund, if the Director determines  
    that the parking impacts of the development can be met by other means.  
    The Director's determination shall be based on any relevant factors  
    including but not limited to the following:  
  
    a.  Proximity of the site to public parking;  
  
    b.  The level of transit service to the lot;  
  
    c.  Proposals by the applicant to encourage building tenants to use  
    alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles.  
  
    5.  The following requirements shall apply to all structures  
    containing more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of  
    nonresidential use:  
  
    a.  A transportation coordinator position shall be established and  
    maintained within the proposed structure to devise and implement  
    alternative means for employee commuting. The coordinator shall be  
    trained by the Seattle Rideshare office or by an alternative  
    organization with ridesharing experience, and shall work with the  
    Seattle Rideshare office, Metro Commuter Pool staff, building tenants,  
    and other building lessors. The coordinator shall disseminate  
    ridesharing information to building occupants to encourage use of  
    public transit, carpools, vanpools and flextime; administer the in-  
    house ridesharing program; and aid in evaluation and monitoring of the  
    ridesharing program. The transportation coordinator in addition shall  
    survey all employees once a year to determine commute mode  
    percentages.  
  
    b.  The Seattle Rideshare office, in conjunction with the  
    transportation coordinator, shall monitor the effectiveness of the  
    ridesharing/transit incentive program on a quarterly basis. The owner  
    or operator of the structure shall grant a designated Seattle  
    Rideshare office representative right of entry to the parking facility  
    to periodically review operation of the carpool set aside program.  
  
    c.  A transportation information center shall be provided and  
    maintained, which has transit information displays including transit  
    route maps and schedules and Seattle ridesharing program information.  
    The transportation display shall be located in the lobby or other  
    location highly visible to employees within the structure prior to  
    issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

    D.  Exceptions.  
  
    1.  Streets With Existing Curbs.  
  
    a.  Streets With Right-of-Way Greater Than or Equal to the Minimum  
    Width. When a street with existing curbs abuts a lot and the existing  
    right-of-way is greater than or equal to the minimum width established  
    in subsection A6 of this section, but the roadway width is less than  
    the minimum established in the Street Improvement Manual, the  
    following requirements shall be met:  
  
    (1)  All structures on the lot shall be designed to accommodate the  
    grade of the future street improvements.  
  
    (2)  A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be  
    required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be  
    recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.  
  
    (3)  If there is no sidewalk, a sidewalk shall be constructed in the  
    portion of the right-of-way abutting the lot, except when the  
    following types of projects are proposed:  
  
    i.  Remodeling and use changes within existing structures; and  
  
    ii.  Additions to existing structures which are exempt from  
    environmental review.  
  
    b.  Streets With Less than the Minimum Right-of-Way Width.  When a  
    street with existing curbs abuts a lot and the existing right-of-way  
    is less than the minimum width established in subsection A5 of this  
    section, the following requirements shall be met:  
  
    (1)  Setback Requirement. A setback equal to half the difference  
    between the current right-of-way width and the minimum right-of-way  
    width established in subsection A6 of this section shall be required;  
    provided, however, that if a setback has been provided under this  
    provision, other lots on the block shall provide the same setback. In  
    all residential zones except Highrise zones, an additional three (3)  
    foot setback shall also be  required.  The area of the setback may be  
    used to meet any development standards, except that required parking  
    may not be located in the setback. Underground structures that  
    which would not prevent the future widening and improvement  
    of the right-of-way may be permitted in the required setback by the  
    Director of Design, Construction and Land Use after consulting  
    with the Director of Transportation.  
  
    (2)  Grading Requirement. When a setback is required, all structures  
    on the lot shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future  
    street according to the Street  Improvement Manual.  
  
    (3)  No-protest Agreement Requirement. A no-protest agreement to  
    future street improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW  
    Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the King County  
    Department of Records and Elections.  
  
    2.  Projects With Reduced Improvement Requirements.  
  
    a.  One (1) or Two (2) Dwelling Units. When one (1) or two (2)  
    dwelling units are proposed to be constructed, or one (1) or two (2)  
    Single Family zoned lots are proposed to be created, the following  
    requirements shall be met:  
  
    (1)  If there is no existing hard-surfaced roadway, a crushed-rock  
    roadway at least sixteen (16) feet in width shall be required,  
    according to the Street Improvement Manual.  
  
    (2)  All structures on the lot(s) shall be designed to accommodate the  
    grade of the future street improvements.  
  
    (3)  A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be  
    required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be  
    recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.  
  
    b.  Other Projects With Reduced Requirements. The types of projects  
    listed in this subsection D2b are exempt from right-of-way dedication  
    requirements and are subject to the street improvement requirements of  
    this subsection:  
  
    (1)  Types of Projects.  
  
    i.  Proposed developments that which contain fewer  
    than ten (10) units in SF, LDT and L1 zones, and six (6) residential  
    units in all other zones;  
  
    ii.  The following uses when they are smaller than seven hundred fifty  
    (750) square feet of gross floor area: fast-food restaurants, major  
    and minor vehicle repair uses, and multipurpose convenience stores;  
  
    iii.  Nonresidential structures that which have less  
    than four thousand (4,000) square feet of gross floor area and that  
     which do not contain uses listed in subsection D2b(1)ii  
    which are larger than seven hundred fifty (750) square feet;  
  
    iv.  Structures containing a mix of residential uses and   
    either nonresidential uses or live-work units, if there are  
    fewer than ten (10) units in SF, LDT and L1 zones, or fewer than six  
    (6) residential units in all other zones, and the square footage of  
    nonresidential use is less than specified in subsections D2b(1)ii and  
    D2b(1)iii;  
  
    v.  Remodeling and use changes within existing structures;  
  
    vi.  Additions to existing structures that which are  
    exempt from environmental review; and  
  
    vii.  Expansions of a surface parking area or open storage area of  
    less than twenty (20) percent of parking area or storage area or  
    number of parking spaces.  
  
    (2)  Paving Requirement. For the types of projects listed in  
    subsection D2b(1), the streets abutting the lot shall have a hard-  
    surfaced roadway at least eighteen (18) feet wide. If there is not an  
    eighteen (18) foot wide hard-surfaced roadway, the roadway shall be  
    paved to a width of at least twenty (20) feet from the lot to the  
    nearest hard-surfaced street meeting this requirement, or one hundred  
    (100) feet, whichever is less. Streets that form a dead end at the  
    property to be developed shall be improved with a cul-de-sac or other  
    vehicular turnaround in accordance with the Street Improvement Manual.  
    The Director, after consulting with the Director of Transportation,  
    shall determine whether the street has the potential for being  
    extended or whether it forms a dead end because of topography and/or  
    the layout of the street system.  
  
    (3)  Other Requirements. The setback, grading and no-protest agreement  
    requirements of subsection D1b shall also be met.  
  
    3.  Exceptions from Required Street Improvements. The Director may  
    waive or modify the requirements for paving and drainage, dedication,  
    setbacks, grading, no-protest agreements, landscaping and curb and  
    sidewalk installation when it is determined that one (1) or more of  
    the following conditions are met:  
  
    a.  Location in an environmentally critical area, disruption of  
    existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as  
    significant trees makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way  
    impractical or undesirable.  
  
    b.  The existence of a bridge, viaduct or structure such as a  
    substantial retaining wall makes widening the right-of-way impractical  
    or undesirable.  
  
    c.  Widening the right-of-way and/or improving the street would  
    adversely affect the character of the street, as it is defined in an  
    adopted neighborhood plan or adopted City plan for green street,  
    boulevards, or other special rights-of-way, or would otherwise  
    conflict with the stated goals of such a plan.  
  
    d.  Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would eliminate street  
    access to an existing lot.  
  
    e.  Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would make building on  
    a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where development  
    standards cannot reasonably be met.  
  
    f.  One (1) or more substantial principal structures on the same side  
    of the block as the proposed project are located in the area needed  
    for future expansion of the right-of-way and the structure(s)'  
    condition and size make future widening of the remainder of the right-  
    of-way unlikely.  
  
    g.  Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is impractical because  
    topography would preclude the use of the street for vehicular access  
    to the lot, for example, due to an inability to meet the  
    required twenty (20) percent maximum driveway slope.  
  
    h.  Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is not necessary  
    because it is adequate for current and potential pedestrian and  
    vehicular traffic, for example, due to the limited number of lots  
    served by the development or because the development on the street is  
    at zoned capacity.

    turnaround shall be provided. The turnaround may be provided by  
    easement.  
  
    (1)  Residential structures with fewer than ten (10) units;  
  
    (2)  The following uses when they are smaller than seven hundred fifty  
    (750) square feet of gross floor area: fast-food restaurants, major

    which  that are larger than seven hundred fifty (750)  
    square feet;  
  
    (4)  Structures containing a mix of residential and either  
    nonresidential uses or live-work units, if the residential use  
    is less than ten (10) units, and the total square footage of  
    nonresidential uses and live-work units is less than specified  
    in subsections E1a(2) and E1a(3);  
  
    (5)  Remodeling and use changes within existing structures;  
  
    (6)  Additions to existing structures that which are  
    exempt from environmental review; and  
  
    (7)  Expansions of a surface parking area or open storage area of less  
    than twenty (20) percent of parking area or storage area or number of  
    parking spaces.  
  
    b.  For projects not listed in subsection E1a, the entire width of the  
    portion of the alley abutting the lot, and the portion of the alley  
    between the lot and a connecting street, shall be paved. The applicant  
    may choose the street to which the pavement will be installed. If the  
    alley does not extend from street to street, and the connecting street  
    is an arterial designated on Exhibit 23.53.015 A, either the remainder  
    of the alley shall be improved so that it is passable to a passenger  
    vehicle, or a turnaround shall be provided.  The turnaround may be  
    provided by easement.  
  
    2.  When the alley is not used for access, if the alley is not fully  
    improved, all structures shall be designed to accommodate the grade of  
    the future alley improvements, and a no-protest agreement to future  
    alley improvements shall be required, as authorized by RCW Chapter  
    35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the King County Department

    they be considered auditoria or public assembly rooms unless they  
    contain bleachers (fixed seats). If the gymnasium contains bleachers,  
    the parking requirement for the entire gymnasium shall be one (1)  
    parking space for every eight (8) fixed seats.  Each twenty (20)  
    inches of width of bleachers shall be counted as one (1) fixed seat  
    for the purposes of determining parking requirements. If the gymnasium  
    does not contain bleachers and is in a school, there is no parking  
    requirement for the gymnasium. If the gymnasium does not contain  
    bleachers and is in a community center, the parking requirement shall  
    be one (1) space for each three hundred fifty (350) square feet.  
    If the gymnasium does not contain bleachers and is in a community  
    center owned and operated by the Department of Parks and Recreation  
    (DOPAR), the parking requirement shall be one (1) space for each five  
    hundred fifty-five (555) square feet.  
  
    3 When family support centers are located within community centers  
    owned and operated by DOPAR, the Director may lower the combined  
    parking requirement by up to a maximum of fifteen (15) percent,  
    pursuant to Section 23.54.020 I.  
  
    4 Parking spaces required for multifamily uses may be provided as  
    tandem spaces according to subsection B of Section 23.54.020.  
  
    5Bedroom-Any habitable room as defined by the Building Code that, in  
    the determination of the Director, is capable of being used as a  
    bedroom.  
  
    6When specified in single-family zones, Section 23.44.015, the  
    Director may waive some or all of the parking requirements.  
  
    7For public schools, when an auditorium or other place of assembly is  
    demolished and a new one built in its place, parking requirements  
    shall be determined based on the new construction. When an existing  
    public school on an existing public school site is remodeled,  
    additional parking is required if any auditorium or other place of  
    assembly is expanded or additional fixed seats are added. Additional  
    parking is required as shown on Chart A for the increase in floor area  
    or increase in number of seats only. If the parking requirement for  
    the increased area or seating is ten (10) percent or less than that  
    for the existing auditorium or other place of assembly, then no  
    additional parking shall be required.  
  
    8 Development standards departure may be granted or required pursuant  
    to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79 to reduce  
    the required or permitted number of parking spaces.  
  
    9 A child care facility, when co-located with an assisted living  
    facility, may count the passenger load/unload space required for the  
    assisted living facility toward its required passenger load/unload  
    spaces.  
  
    10 When a library is permitted in single-family zones as a  
    conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements  
    pursuant to Section 23.44.022; when a library is permitted in  
    multifamily zones as a conditional use, the Director may modify the  
    parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.45.122; and when a library  
    is permitted in commercial zones, the Director may modify the parking  
    requirements pursuant to Section 23.44.022 L.  
  
    11 Required parking for spectator sports facilities or exhibition  
    halls must be available when the facility or exhibition hall is in  
    use. A facility shall be considered to be "in use" during the period  
    beginning three (3) hours before an event is scheduled to begin and  
    ending one (1) hour after a scheduled event is expected to end. For  
    sports events of variable or uncertain duration, the expected event  
    length shall be the average length of the events of the same type for  
    which the most recent data are available, provided it is within the  
    past five (5) years. During an inaugural season, or for nonrecurring  
    events, the best available good faith estimate of event duration will  
    be used. A facility will not be deemed to be "in use" by virtue of the  
    fact that administrative or maintenance personnel are present. The  
    Director may reduce the required parking for any event when projected  
    attendance for a spectator sports facility is certified to be fifty  
    (50) percent or less of the facility's seating capacity, to an amount  
    not less than that required for the certified projected attendance, at  
    the rate of one (1) space for each ten (10) fixed seats of certified  
    projected attendance. An application for reduction and the  
    certification shall be submitted to the Director at least fifteen (15)  
    days prior to the event. When the event is one of a series of similar  
    events, such certification may be submitted for the entire series  
    fifteen (15) days prior to the first event in the series. If the  
    Director finds that a certification of projected attendance of fifty  
    (50) percent or less of the seating capacity is based on satisfactory  
    evidence such as past attendance at similar events or advance ticket  
    sales, the Director shall, within fifteen (15) days of such submittal,  
    notify the facility operator that a reduced parking requirement has  
    been approved, with any conditions deemed appropriate by the Director  
    to ensure adequacy of parking if expected attendance should change.  
    The parking requirement reduction may be applied for only if the goals  
    of the facility's Transportation Management Plan are otherwise being  
    met. The Director may revoke or modify a parking requirement reduction  
    approval during a series, if projected attendance is exceeded.  
  
    12 For purposes of this section, Center City neighborhoods are the  
    following urban villages: Uptown Queen Anne, South Lake Union, Capitol  
    Hill, Pike/Pine, First Hill, and 12th Avenue, as shown in the  
    City of Seattle Comprehensive Plan.  
  
    13 These general requirements for multifamily uses are superseded to  
    the extent that a use, structure or development qualifies for either a  
    greater or a lesser parking requirement under any provision below.  To  
    the extent that more than one of the provisions below applies to a  
    multifamily use, the least of the applicable parking requirements  
    applies.  The different parking requirements for certain multifamily  
    uses listed below shall not be construed to create separate uses for  
    purposes of any requirements related to establishing or changing a use  
    under this title.  
  
    14 Notice of Income Restrictions. Prior to issuance of any permit to  
    establish, construct or modify any use or structure, or to reduce any  
    parking accessory to a multifamily use or structure, if the applicant  
    relies upon these reduced parking requirements, the applicant shall  
    record in the King County Office of Records and Elections a  
    declaration signed and acknowledged by the owner(s), in a form  
    prescribed by the Director, which shall identify the subject property  
    by legal description, and shall acknowledge and provide notice to any  
    prospective purchasers that specific income limits are a condition for  
    maintaining the reduced parking requirement.

    b.  When more than five (5) parking spaces are provided, a minimum of  
    sixty (60) percent of the parking spaces shall be striped for medium  
    vehicles. The minimum size for a medium parking space shall also be  
    the maximum size. Forty (40) percent of the parking spaces may be  
    striped for any size, provided that when parking spaces are striped  
    for large vehicles, the minimum required aisle width shall be as shown  
    for medium vehicles.  
  
    c.  Assisted Living Facilities. Parking spaces shall be provided as in  
    subsections B1a and B1b above, except that a minimum of two (2) spaces  
    shall be striped for a large vehicle.  
  
    2.  Nonresidential Uses and Live-Work Units.  
  
    a.  When ten (10) or fewer parking spaces are provided, a maximum of

    of the parking spaces may be striped for small vehicles. A minimum of  
    thirty-five (35) percent of the spaces shall be striped for large  
    vehicles.  
  
    d.  The minimum vehicle clearance shall be at least six (6) feet nine  
    (9) inches on at least one (1) floor, and there shall be at least one  
    (1) direct entrance from the street that is at least six (6) feet  
    nine (9) inches in height for all parking garages accessory to  
    nonresidential uses and live-work units and for all  
    principal use parking garages which is at least six (6) feet nine  
    (9) inches in height.  
  
    *     *     *  
  
    D.  Driveways. Driveway requirements for residential, and  
    nonresidential uses and live-work units are described below.  
    When a driveway is used for both residential and either  
    nonresidential or live-work parking, it shall meet the standards  
    for nonresidential uses described in subsection D2.  
  
    1.  Residential Uses.  
  
    a.  Driveways shall be at least ten (10) feet wide. Driveways with a  
    turning radius of more than thirty-five (35) degrees shall conform to  
    the minimum turning path radius shown in Exhibit 23.54.030 B.  
  
    b.  Vehicles may back onto a street from a parking area serving five  
    (5) or fewer vehicles, provided that:  
  
    (1)  The street is not an arterial as defined in Section 11.18.010 of  
    the Seattle Municipal Code;  
  
    (2)  The slope of the driveway does not exceed ten (10) percent in the  
    first twenty (20) feet from the property line; and  
  
    (3)  For one (1) single-family structure, the Director may waive the  
    requirements of subsections D1b(1) and (2) above, and may modify the  
    parking access standards based upon a safety analysis, addressing  
    visibility, traffic volume and other relevant issues.  
  
    c.  Driveways less than one hundred (100) feet in length, which serve  
    thirty (30) or fewer parking spaces, shall be a minimum of ten (10)  
    feet in width for one (1) way or two (2) way traffic.  
  
    d.  Except for driveways serving one (1) single-family dwelling,  
    driveways more than one hundred (100) feet in length which serve  
    thirty (30) or fewer parking spaces shall either:  
  
    (1)  Be a minimum of sixteen (16) feet wide, tapered over a twenty  
    (20) foot distance to a ten (10) foot opening at the property line; or  
  
    (2)  Provide a passing area at least twenty (20) feet wide and twenty  
    (20) feet long. The passing area shall begin twenty (20) feet from the  
    property line, with an appropriate taper to meet the ten (10) foot  
    opening at the property line. If a taper is provided at the other end  
    of the passing area, it shall have a minimum length of twenty (20)  
    feet.  
  
    e.  Driveways serving more than thirty (30) parking spaces shall  
    provide a minimum ten (10) foot wide driveway for one (1) way traffic  
    or a minimum twenty (20) foot wide driveway for two (2) way traffic.  
  
    f.  Nonconforming Driveways. The number of parking spaces served by an  
    existing driveway that does not meet the standards of this subsection  
    D1 shall not be increased. This prohibition may be waived by the  
    Director after consulting with Seattle Department of  
    Transportation based on a safety analysis.  
  
    2.  Nonresidential Uses and Live-Work Units.  
  
    a.  Driveway Widths.  
  
    (1)  The minimum width of driveways for one (1) way traffic shall be  
    twelve (12) feet and the maximum width shall be fifteen (15) feet.  
  
    (2)  The minimum width of driveways for two (2) way traffic shall be  
    twenty-two (22) feet and the maximum width shall be twenty-five (25)

    4.  Driveway Slope. No portion of a driveway, whether located on  
    private property or on a right-of-way, shall exceed a slope of twenty  
    (20) percent, except as provided in this subsection. The maximum  
    twenty (20) percent slope shall apply in relation to both the current  
    grade of the right-of-way to which the driveway connects, and to the  
    proposed finished grade of the right-of-way if it is different from  
    the current grade. The Director may permit a driveway slope of more  
    than twenty (20) percent if it is found that:  
  
    a.  The topography or other special characteristic of the lot makes a  
    twenty (20) percent maximum driveway slope infeasible;  
  
    b.  The additional amount of slope permitted is the least amount  
    necessary to accommodate the conditions of the lot; and  
  
    c.  The driveway is still useable as access to the lot.  
  
    *     *     *  
  
    F.  Curbcuts. Curbcut requirements shall be determined by whether the  
    parking served by the curbcut is for residential or nonresidential  
    use, and by the zone in which the use is located.  When a curbcut is  
    used for more than one (1) use or for one or more live-work units  
    , the requirements for the use with the largest curbcut requirements  
    shall apply.  
  
    1.  Residential Uses in Single-family and Multi-family Zones and  
    Single-purpose Residential Uses in All Other Zones.  
  
    a.  For lots not located on a principal arterial as designated on  
    Exhibit 23.53.015 A, the number of curbcuts permitted shall be  
    according to the following chart:  
  
    Street or Easement                     Number of  
    Frontage of the Lot                Curbcuts Permitted

    For lots with frontage in excess of three hundred twenty (320) feet,  
    the pattern established in the chart shall be continued.  
  
    b.  Curbcuts shall not exceed a maximum width of ten (10) feet except  
    that:  
  
    (1)  One (1) curbcut greater than ten (10) feet but in no case greater  
    than twenty (20) feet in width may be substituted for each two (2)  
    curbcuts permitted by subsection F1a; and  
  
    (2)  A greater width may be specifically permitted by the development  
    standards in a zone; and  
  
    (3)  When subsection D of Section  23.54.030 requires a driveway  
    greater than ten (10) feet in width, the curbcut may be as wide as the  
    required width of the driveway.  
  
    c.  For lots on principal arterials designated on Exhibit 23.53.015 A,  
    curbcuts of a maximum width of twenty-three (23) feet shall be  
    permitted according to the following chart.  
  
    Street Frontage                        Number of  
    of the Lot                         Curbcuts Permitted  
  
    0-160 feet                                 1  
  
    161-320 feet                               2  
  
    321-480 feet                               3  
  
    For lots with street frontage in excess of four hundred eighty (480)  
    feet, the pattern established in the chart shall be continued.  
  
    d.  There shall be at least thirty (30) feet between any two (2)  
    curbcuts located on a lot.  
  
    e.  A curbcut may be less than the maximum width permitted but shall  
    be at least as wide as the minimum required width of the driveway it  
    serves.  
  
    f.  Where two (2) adjoining lots share a common driveway according to  
    the provisions of Section  23.54.030 D1, the combined frontage of the  
    two (2) lots shall be considered one (1) in determining the maximum  
    number of permitted curbcuts.  
  
    2.  Nonresidential Uses in Single-family and Multifamily Zones, and  
    All Uses, Except Single-purpose Residential Uses, in All Other Zones  
    Except Industrial Zones.  
  
    a.  Number of Curbcuts.  
  
    (1)  In RC, NC1, NC2 and NC3 zones and within Major Institution  
    Overlay Districts, the number of two-way curbcuts permitted shall be  
    according to the following chart:  
  
    Street Frontage                    Number of Curbcuts  
    of the Lot                             Permitted

    361-480 feet                               4  
  
    For lots with frontage in excess of four hundred eighty (480) feet the  
    pattern established in the chart shall be continued. The Director may  
    allow two (2) one-way curbcuts to be substituted for one (1) two-way  
    curbcut, after determining that there would not be a significant  
    conflict with pedestrian traffic.  
  
    (2)  In C1 and C2 zones and the SCM zone, the Director shall review  
    and make a recommendation on the number and location of curbcuts.  
  
    (3)  In downtown zones, a maximum of two (2) curbcuts for one (1) way  
    traffic at least forty (40) feet apart, or one (1) curbcut for two (2)  
    way traffic, shall be permitted on each street front where access is  
    permitted by Section  23.49.018.  No curbcut shall be located within  
    forty (40) feet of an intersection. These standards may be modified by  
    the Director on lots with steep slopes or other special conditions,  
    the minimum necessary to provide vehicular and pedestrian safety and  
    facilitate a smooth flow of traffic.  
  
    (4)  For public schools, the minimum number of curbcuts determined  
    necessary by the Director shall be permitted.  
  
    b.  Curbcut Widths.  
  
    (1)  For one (1) way traffic, the minimum width of curbcuts shall be  
    twelve (12) feet, and the maximum width shall be fifteen (15) feet.  
  
    (2)  For two (2) way traffic, the minimum width of curbcuts shall be  
    twenty-two (22) feet, and the maximum width shall be twenty-five (25)  
    feet, except that the maximum width may be increased to thirty (30)  
    feet when truck and auto access are combined.  
  
    (3)  For public schools, the maximum width of curbcuts shall be  
    twenty-five (25) feet. Development standards departure may be granted  
    or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in  
    Chapter 23.79.  
  
    (4)  When one (1) of the following conditions applies, the Director  
    may require a curbcut of up to thirty (30) feet in width, if it is  
    found that a wider curbcut is necessary for safe access:  
  
    i.  The abutting street has a single lane on the side that   
    which abuts the lot; or  
  
    ii.  The curb lane abutting the lot is less than eleven (11) feet  
    wide; or  
  
    iii.  The proposed development is located on an arterial with an  
    average daily traffic volume of over seven thousand (7,000) vehicles;  
    or  
  
    iv.  Off-street loading space is required according to subsection H of  
    Section 23.54.015.  
  
    c.  The entrances to all garages accessory to nonresidential uses   
    or live-work units and the entrances to all principal use parking  
    garages shall be at least six (6) feet nine (9) inches high.  
  
    3.  All Uses in Industrial Zones.  
  
    a.  Number and Location of Curbcuts. The number and location of  
    curbcuts shall be determined by the Director.  
  
    b.  Curbcut Width. Curbcut width in Industrial zones shall be provided  
    as follows:  
  
    (1)  When the curbcut provides access to a parking area or structure  
    it shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet wide and a maximum of  
    thirty (30) feet wide.  
  
    (2)  When the curbcut provides access to a loading berth, the maximum  
    width of thirty (30) feet set in subsection F3b(1) may be increased to  
    fifty (50) feet.  
  
    (3)  Within the minimum and maximum widths established by this  
    subsection, the Director shall determine the size of the curbcuts.  
  
    4.  Curbcuts for Access Easements.  
  
    a.  When a lot is crossed by an access easement serving other lots,  
    the curbcut serving the easement may be as wide as the easement  
    roadway.  
  
    b.  The curbcut serving an access easement shall not be counted  
    against the number or amount of curbcut permitted to a lot if the lot  
    is not itself served by the easement.  
  
    5.  Curbcut Flare. A flare with a maximum width of two and one-half  
    (2-1/2) feet shall be permitted on either side of curbcuts in any  
    zone.  
  
    6.  Replacement of Unused Curbcuts. When a curbcut is no longer needed  
    to provide access to a lot, the curb and any planting strip shall be  
    replaced.  
  
    *     *     *  
  
    J.  The Director may reduce any required dimension for nonresidential  
    uses and live-work units up to three (3) percent to allow more
