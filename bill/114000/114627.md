    ORDINANCE _________________  
  
    AN ORDINANCE relating to firefighting, life-safety and other emergency  
    response facilities; providing for the submission to the voters of the  
    City, at an election to be held therein on November 4, 2003, in  
    conjunction with the state general election to be held on the same  
    date, of a proposition authorizing the City to incur indebtedness by  
    issuing its general obligation bonds, payable by annual property tax  
    levies to be made in excess of regular property tax levies, for the  
    purpose of paying all or a part of the cost of designing,  
    constructing, acquiring, improving, renovating, and equipping  
    firefighting, life-safety, and other emergency response facilities and  
    authorizing the City to levy those excess property taxes; and  
    establishing an oversight committee.  
  
    WHEREAS, the City of Seattle, Washington (the "City"), owns many  
    critical facilities that house fire engine companies, ladder  
    companies, and emergency medical services and other specialty units to  
    mitigate loss of life and property resulting from fires, medical  
    emergencies, and other disasters; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City operates 33 fire stations, built between 1928 and  
    1977; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City generally maintains fire and other emergency  
    facilities in satisfactory operating condition, but has not  
    significantly upgraded, expanded, or modernized those facilities since  
    the voter-approved 1-2-3 Bond program of 1984; and  
  
    WHEREAS, fire and other emergency service delivery has evolved over  
    the last 20 years in response to national professional standards,  
    legal mandates, and newly recognized risks from terrorism and  
    hazardous materials; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Loma Prieta earthquake in California on October 17, 1989,  
    the Northridge earthquake in California on January 17, 1994, the Kobe  
    earthquake in Japan on January 15, 1995, and the Nisqually Earthquake  
    in Seattle in February 2001, highlighted the potential for seismic  
    damage in Seattle and the need for the City to continue to prepare for  
    future earthquakes and to reevaluate the structural conditions of  
    essential public safety facilities; and  
  
    WHEREAS, since 1996 various studies identified significant seismic  
    vulnerabilities at 32 of the City's 33 fire stations, culminating in a  
    study completed in 2003 that produced a range of options for fire  
    facility improvements; and  
  
    WHEREAS, marina fires in 2001 and 2002 highlighted the shortcomings of  
    the City's current fire-fighting capacity and response times on both  
    fresh and salt water; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the fire boat Chief Seattle, in operation since 1986,  
    requires significant renovation work to remain in service for the next  
    25 years and the fire boat Alki, in operation since 1928, is of  
    advanced age and limited fire fighting capacity; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City's existing emergency operations center, which is  
    critical to the coordination of emergency services in response to  
    natural and manmade disasters, is housed in a facility that is  
    seismically vulnerable, too small for modern operations, and is  
    exposed to various natural and manmade hazards; and  
  
    WHEREAS, staff from the Fleets and Facilities Department, Seattle Fire  
    Department and Department of Finance, under the direction of a client  
    group that included department heads from those departments and  
    representatives from the Mayor's office and City Council, developed  
    detailed programming and feasibility analyses for fire operations and  
    facilities requirements; and  
  
    WHEREAS, future citizens of Seattle will reap the benefits of capital  
    improvements to fire and other emergency services facilities made with  
    funding authorized by today's voters, making it appropriate to pay for  
    those improvements over a period of 20 years; NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1.  Definitions.  As used in this ordinance, the following  
    words shall have the following meanings:  
  
    "Bond Plan" means designing, constructing, acquiring, improving,  
    renovating, and equipping capital improvement projects that show  
    entries for "Bond Proceeds Allocations" in Attachment A, with any  
    modifications and additions that may be authorized as permitted by  
    this ordinance, for providing firefighting, life-safety, and other  
    emergency response services designed to address seismic  
    vulnerabilities, replace aging assets, respond to new national  
    professional standards, legal mandates, and newly recognized risks  
    from terrorism and hazardous materials.  In addition to the Bond Plan,  
    if the voters approve the funding proposition submitted to them  
    pursuant to this ordinance, the City intends to use other existing or  
    projected revenue sources to pay, over a ten-year period, for the  
    projects that show entries only for "Other City Funding Sources" in  
    Attachment A.  Some or all of these additional projects may be delayed  
    or eliminated if expected revenues are not available.  
  
    "Bond Proceeds" means the purchase price received by the City from the  
    sale of the unlimited tax general obligation bonds authorized by this  
    ordinance.  
  
    "Neighborhood Stations" includes structures that are designed to house  
    or moor one or more firefighting or emergency services vehicles,  
    vessels, or other apparatus, and which may include facilities in or  
    associated with those structures to accommodate the needs of  
    firefighters and other emergency services personnel.  
  
    "Support Facilities" includes facilities to house operations,  
    training, and other administrative and regulatory functions such as  
    but not limited to monitoring fire alarms and fire code compliance and  
    investigating fires, and also includes costs of issuing bonds and of  
    interim financing.  
  
    "Emergency Preparedness" includes improvements designed to reduce or  
    mitigate vulnerabilities to disasters or to facilitate emergency  
    responses such as but not limited to hardening hydrants and other  
    facilities for supplying water for firefighting, improving power  
    supplies to emergency shelters, establishing a new emergency  
    operations center, and creating and equipping caches of emergency  
    supplies.  
  
    "Marine" includes acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of one  
    or more fireboats or other vessels for firefighting or other emergency  
    response.  
  
    Section 2.  Authorization of Bonds and Use of Bond Proceeds.  
  
      A.  If the voters of the City of Seattle (the "City") approve the  
    proposition submitted to them pursuant to this ordinance, the City  
    shall be authorized to borrow not to exceed $156,211,000 on the credit  
    of the City and issue and sell its unlimited tax general obligation  
    bonds in that principal amount for strictly municipal capital  
    purposes, other than the replacement of equipment, to provide funds  
    for the Bond Plan, including costs of issuance of the bonds.  Costs of  
    architectural, engineering, planning, financial, interim financing,  
    legal and other costs and services lawfully incurred incident to the  
    Bond Plan, together with costs of site preparation, landscaping,  
    relocation, utilities, the costs of issuance of the bonds and of  
    short-term interim financing authorized by this ordinance, and such  
    other costs related to the Bond Plan as the City Council may deem  
    proper, shall be appropriate capital costs to be paid from the  
    proceeds of such bonds.  Capital improvements within the Bond Plan  
    shall consist of the following four categories:  
  
    Categories  
  
    Anticipated Allocation of Bond Proceeds  
  
    Neighborhood Stations  
  
    $92,830,000  
  
    Support Facilities  
  
    $$33,032,000  
  
    Emergency Preparedness  
  
    $18,725,000  
  
    Marine  
  
    $11,624,000  
  
    Total  
  
    $156,211,000  
  
    Total funding from Bond Proceeds for each category shall not exceed  
    the respective amounts identified above unless the City in an  
    ordinance passed by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the City Council  
    determines to reallocate Bond Proceeds after considering any  
    recommendations that may have been made by the Mayor or by the  
    oversight committee established in Section 5.  
  
      B.  Specific projects on which Bond Proceeds may be spent within  
    each of the categories, with the estimated amount of Bond Proceeds to  
    be devoted to each project, are shown in the "Bond Proceeds  
    Allocation" column in Attachment A.  Total expenditure of Bond  
    Proceeds on each project shall not exceed the amount of Bond Proceeds  
    shown for that project in Attachment A by more than ten percent unless  
    the City Council approves the additional expenditure by ordinance.  
  
      C.  Each year by the end of August, the Fleets and Facilities  
    Department or its functional successor (the "Department") shall submit  
    to the City Council a report on spending to date of the Bond Proceeds  
    and any interest earnings thereon, and a proposed spending plan  
    allocating expected Bond Proceeds and any interest earnings thereon  
    among the categories and projects for the upcoming budget year and for  
    any additional years in which the Department plans to spend Bond  
    Proceeds or interest earned thereon, and shall indicate if interest  
    earnings are proposed to be used to reduce the amount of excess taxes  
    to be levied to pay debt service.  
  
      D.  The economic life of the Bond Plan's capital improvements to be  
    funded with Bond Proceeds is expected to be at least twenty (20)  
    years, although the useful life of individual projects will vary from  
    this number.  
  
    Section 3.  Alterations and Additions to Bond Plan.  
  
      A.  Projects may be added to a category only by an ordinance passed  
    by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the City Council after considering any  
    recommendations that may have been made by the Mayor or by the  
    oversight committee established in Section 5.  
  
      B.  The City intends to complete all projects shown in Attachment A  
    using Bond Proceeds and other funds that may become available.  If,  
    however, the City determines in an ordinance passed by a two-thirds  
    (2/3) vote of the City Council, after considering any recommendations  
    that may have been made by the Mayor or by the oversight committee  
    established in Section 5, that it is impractical or no longer  
    desirable to complete a project that is part of the Bond Plan, that  
    project may be deleted.  
  
      C.  The City may seek supplemental, matching or additional funds  
    from other sources to pay all or part of the cost of a project and, if  
    successful, may apply such funds to accomplishment thereof or to  
    complement or enlarge a project.  
  
      D.  If all projects in a category have been completed or deleted,  
    and any remaining Bond Proceeds allocated to that category have not  
    been reallocated by the City Council as authorized in Subsection 2A  
    above, then the Director of Executive Administration, with the  
    concurrence of the Director of Finance, may deposit such unexpended  
    and unallocated Bond Proceeds in the General Bond Interest and  
    Redemption Fund, which has heretofore been established in the City  
    Treasury, in order to reduce the excess taxes needed to pay the  
    principal of and interest on the bonds issued pursuant to this  
    ordinance.  
  
    Section 4.  Deposit of Bonds Proceeds.  The proceeds of bonds issued  
    pursuant to this ordinance shall be deposited into a special subfund  
    or other accounting unit in the City Treasury referred to as the 2003  
    Fire Facilities Fund (the "Fund") or such other designation as the  
    Director of Executive Administration shall determine.  Money in the  
    Fund may be temporarily deposited or invested in such manner as may be  
    lawful for the investment of City money, may be used to pay interest  
    on bonds, or may be loaned to the General Bond Interest and Redemption  
    Fund for up to 18 months at a time, at a rate of interest that  
    reflects the interest earned on the City's consolidated cash pool for  
    the purpose of making debt service payments, and interest and other  
    earnings on money in the Fund shall be deposited in the Fund.  The  
    Bond Proceeds shall be applied solely to carry out the Bond Plan.  The  
    Director of Executive Administration is authorized to create other  
    subfunds or accounts as may be needed to implement the purposes of  
    this ordinance.  
  
    Section 5.  Oversight Committee.  
  
      A.  If the voters of the City approve the proposition submitted to  
    them pursuant to this ordinance, the Fire Facilities Oversight  
    Committee ("FFOC") is hereby established, for so long as Bond Proceeds  
    remain.  The FFOC shall have the authority to provide policy direction  
    and technical advice on implementation of particular projects,  
    including but not limited to issues such as construction staging,  
    design, site selection, and contracting approaches; to review the  
    expenditure of Bond Proceeds; and to advise upon expenditures and  
    allocations of Bond Proceeds.  Input from the FFOC is not a condition  
    precedent to City action on any Bond Plan matter.  The City Council  
    shall not be bound by the recommendations or advice of the FFOC or its  
    members.  The FFOC will meet quarterly with the Fleets and Facilities  
    Director or his or her designee, beginning in the calendar quarter  
    following the successful passage of the ballot measure submitted to  
    the voters pursuant to this ordinance, unless that schedule is changed  
    by a majority of the FFOC.  
  
      B.  The FFOC shall consist of six (6) members.  One shall be a  
    "Seattle resident" with financial or relevant technical expertise who  
    shall be selected by the City Council; two shall be members of the  
    City Council selected by the City Council; two shall be City employees  
    selected by the Mayor; and one shall be a uniformed Seattle fire  
    fighter below the rank of Battalion Chief selected by the Mayor.  
    Members shall be selected for the duration of the Bond Plan.  The  
    "Seattle resident" member shall be subject to removal by the City  
    Council for being absent without good cause from two (2) consecutive  
    meetings or for moving his or her residence from Seattle, or for other  
    cause.  Others shall cease to be members if they no longer belong to  
    the group from which selected.  Vacancies shall be filled by the  
    original selecting authority.  Members shall serve without pay but, at  
    the option of the Director of Fleets and Facilities, the "Seattle  
    resident" member may be reimbursed his or her expenses from Bond  
    Proceeds, including payments for child care while attending meetings.  
    The FFOC may adopt rules for its own procedures, including quorum  
    requirements and the frequency of meetings.  
  
      Section 6.  Bond Issuance and Tax Levy.  The bonds authorized by  
    this ordinance may be issued as a single issue, as a part of a  
    combined issue with other authorized bonds, or in more than one  
    series.  The bonds shall bear interest payable as permitted by law;  
    shall mature not later than 2024 or within any shorter period fixed by  
    the City Council; shall be payable by annual property tax levies  
    sufficient in amount to pay both principal and interest when due,  
    which annual property tax levies shall be made in excess of regular  
    property tax levies without limitation as to rate or amount, in  
    amounts determined by the City Council to be sufficient to pay both  
    principal and interest when due; and shall be issued and sold in the  
    manner, at the times and in the amounts as shall be required for the  
    Bond Plan.  The exact date, form, terms, option of prior redemption,  
    if any, price, interest rate or rates and maturities of the bonds  
    shall be fixed hereafter by or pursuant to ordinance of the City  
    Council.  Pending the issuance of the bonds and receipt of their  
    proceeds, the City Council may authorize the issuance of short-term  
    obligations pursuant to Chapter 39.50 RCW.  
  
    Section 7.  Election - Ballot Title.  The City Council finds that an  
    emergency exists that requires proposing the Bond Plan and requests  
    that the Director of Records and Elections of King County, Washington,  
    as ex officio Supervisor of Elections, find the existence of an  
    emergency pursuant to RCW 29.13.020 and call and conduct a special  
    election in the City in conjunction with the state general election to  
    be held on November 4, 2003, for the purpose of submitting to the  
    qualified electors of the City the proposition set forth below.  The  
    City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to certify the  
    proposition to the King County Director of Records and Elections in  
    the following form:
