    AN ORDINANCE amending Section 1.20.010 of the Seattle Municipal Code  
    and Ordinances 383 and 1836 to adopt an updated vertical and  
    horizontal reference datum for all City of Seattle departments and  
    outside entities as a standard reference plane upon which elevations  
    are based in the City of Seattle, or on properties and/or  
    infrastructures owned, funded or maintained by the City of Seattle, or  
    requiring City of Seattle permits or applicants, and amending  
    subsection A of Section 23.22.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code to  
    require that certain measurements for preliminary plats be based on  
    the updated vertical and horizontal datum.  
  
    WHEREAS, the local vertical datum was established in 1883 by Ordinance  
    No. 383, and amended in 1891 by Ordinance No. 1836, known as the City  
    of Seattle Datum; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the current City of Seattle Datum was established by  
    inconsistent and outdated methods and technologies and does not  
    provide a consistent and reliable single vertical reference datum; and  
  
    WHEREAS, it is in the interest of the City of Seattle to have a  
    standard, regional, and consistent vertical and horizontal reference  
    system; and  
  
    WHEREAS, it is in the interests of the public safety, health and  
    welfare that elements of the City of Seattle's infrastructure,  
    utilities and transportation share a common vertical and horizontal  
    reference system; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the United States National Geodetic Survey has established a  
    national standard vertical reference system known as the North  
    American Vertical Datum of 1988; and a national horizontal reference  
    system known as the North American Datum of 1983, adjusted in 1991;  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, RCW 58.20 establishes the "Washington coordinate system of  
    1983," based on the North American Datum of 1983, as determined by the  
    National Geodetic Survey of the United States Department of Commerce,  
    as a system for expressing positions or locations of points on the  
    surface of the earth; and  
  
    WHEREAS, state, local, and regional entities have adopted the  
    Washington Coordinate System as a standard for expressing positions  
    and locations of utilities, transportation elements, and other  
    infrastructure in Geographic Information Systems, engineering records,  
    mapping and land records; and  
  
    WHEREAS, published coordinates for the United States National Geodetic  
    Survey geodetic control monuments, that provide the physical  
    constraints for establishing coordinate values in the Washington  
    Coordinate System, represent the 1991 adjustment of the North American  
    Datum of 1983, and the City of Seattle's primary control network  
    monuments have been constrained to said monuments and adjusted to the  
    North American Datum of 1983 (1991 adjustment) per WAC chapter 332-  
    130-060; and  
  
    WHEREAS, present surveying, engineering and Geographic Information  
    Systems methods and technologies provide for and make practicable the  
    establishment and adherence to a common horizontal reference system;  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Central Geographic Data Base of the City of Seattle  
    Geographic Information System was developed in and maintained in the  
    North American Datum of 1983 (1991 adjustment), and a long standing  
    goal of the City of Seattle Geographic Information Systems is to  
    include elements from engineering design projects and other sources of  
    horizontally reference spatial features; NOW, THEREFORE,

    (NAVD88) and the North American Datum of 1983 (1991 adjustment) [NAD83  
    (1991)] are adopted as the new official vertical and horizontal datums

    Section 2.  To distinguish between the historical and new vertical  
    datum when it is necessary to refer to both, they shall be known

    when there is a vertical component of the work or whenever an  
    elevation is noted; and shall reference the NAD83 (1991) datum when

    whenever an elevation is noted, and shall reference the NAD83 (1991)  
    datum when there is any reference to a horizontal datum (any reference  
    to bearings, azimuths, or geographical or state plane coordinates).

    Bridge, and Municipal Construction, Standard Specification 1-05.5,
