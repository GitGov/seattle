    ORDINANCE _________________  
  
    AN ORDINANCE relating to the 2003 Budget; carrying forward certain  
    unexpended appropriations from the 2002 budget of various departments  
    and funds for both capital and non-capital purposes; all by a three-  
    fourths vote of the City Council.  
  
    WHEREAS, RCW 35.32A.080 provides that unexpended and unencumbered  
    appropriations for capital purposes automatically carry forward from  
    each budget year to the next unless abandoned by ordinance; and  
  
    WHEREAS, appropriations for the City's Capital Improvement Program are  
    readily identifiable as being capital in nature and therefore  
    automatically carry forward without Council action; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City makes some appropriations for capital purposes that  
    are not readily identifiable as capital appropriations because they  
    are not for the Capital Improvement Program, but the City Council  
    intends that those capital appropriations also carry forward as  
    provided in RCW 35.32A.080; and  
  
    WHEREAS, certain City departments and agencies have unexpended 2002  
    non-capital appropriations the Council has determined should carry  
    forward into the 2003 Budget but which were not included in the  
    Adopted 2003 Budget; NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1. Capital Carry Forward.  The Department of Finance shall  
    certify to the Chair of the City Council Finance, Budget, Business,  
    and Labor Committee a list of those unexpended appropriations in the  
    2002 Budget which were for capital purposes but were not for the  
    Capital Improvement Program.  The Chair shall file the certification  
    with the City Clerk.  Those appropriations are automatically carried  
    forward to the 2003 Budget for those same capital purposes under the  
    provisions of RCW 35.32A.080.
