    AN ORDINANCE authorizing the execution of  the First Amendment to  
    1998 Agreement Between The City of Seattle and the University of  
    Washington to revise land acquisition and leasing provisions of that  
    Agreement.  
  
    WHEREAS, the University of Washington is Seattle's largest employer  
    with 24,000 employees at the central campus; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the University of Washington confers more than 10,000  
    degrees a year, including almost one third of all bachelor's degrees  
    and master's degrees, two thirds of all Ph.D.'s and half of all  
    professional degrees awarded in the state; and  
  
    WHEREAS, a well-educated work force boosts Seattle's economic  
    productivity, generates innovation, and acts as a magnet for leading-  
    edge, high-paying businesses; and  
  
    WHEREAS, since 1974, the University of Washington has been the number  
    one public university in the United States in receiving federal  
    support for research and training, and in fiscal year 2002 received  
    more than $800 million in public and private grant and contract  
    support; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the University of Washington researchers who attract public  
    and private grant and contract support need additional office and  
    research space for the duration of their grants; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the University of Washington has nearly reached its limit of  
    550,000 square feet of leased space in the primary and secondary  
    impact zones, currently barring researchers from leasing additional  
    space in those areas; and  
  
    WHEREAS, a lease lid was imposed upon the University of Washington in  
    the 1970s, and other major institutions in the 1980s in order to  
    prevent the conversion of housing to institutional uses in  
    surrounding neighborhoods; and  
  
    WHEREAS, lease lids on major institutions, except for the University  
    of Washington, were lifted in 1996 by Ordinance118362, and were  
    replaced by policies encouraging development inside of Major  
    Institution Overlay District boundaries and requiring major  
    institutions to report activity occurring within 2500 feet outside  
    their boundaries; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Council Resolution 29488 directed the City's Department of  
    Design, Construction and Land Use to establish an annual reporting  
    program to monitor development and leasing trends subsequent to the  
    December 1996 baseline report, and no significant negative effects  
    have been observed; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Vision Statement for the University Community Urban  
    Center Plan states "The University Community will seek an active  
    partnership with the University of Washington as a catalyst for  
    positive change involved in both residential and business concerns";  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, the University of Washington is subject to current land use  
    regulations in the University District, which include Commercial  
    zones, Neighborhood Commercial zones, and pedestrian-designated  
    streets where certain street-level uses are required to preserve the  
    streetfront's commercial or pedestrian-oriented character; and  
  
    WHEREAS, University of Washington employees and researchers located  
    in the primary and secondary impact zones are subject to the  
    University of Washington Transportation Management Plan, which  
    includes programs to reduce commuting by single-occupant vehicles,  
    and will enable students and faculty employed by the University's  
    research activities to be located within walking distance of  
    classrooms, libraries, and offices on campus; and  
  
    WHEREAS, allowing University of Washington researchers and other  
    University activities to lease more space in the University District  
    will likely reduce vacancy rates and stimulate economic activity;  
  
    WHEREAS, residents of communities surrounding the University are  
    plagued by the negative effects of overoccupied rental dwellings that  
    house students off-campus in single-family homes that have been  
    converted to multi-unit tenancies, and  
  
    WHEREAS, the University has agreed to use its authority to stabilize  
    adjacent residential neighborhoods and mitigate pressures for multi-  
    unit conversions of single-family homes as the University extends its  
    leasing of commercial properties in the University District; NOW  
    THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1.  The Mayor is hereby authorized to execute, on behalf of  
    the City, the First Amendment to the 1998 Agreement between The City

    provide this analysis to the University and CUCAC for their review  
    and comment prior to submission to the City Council.  
  
    III.    Replacement of Section II.E.  The parties intend that the  
    limitations on leasing and acquisitions in section II. E. of the  
    City-University Agreement be changed to allow the University of  
    Washington to use leased and acquired property consistent with the  
    Seattle Land Use Code, subject to certain limitations.  The parties  
    hereby agree that the City-University Agreement be amended by  
    replacing Section II.E., Land Acquisition and Leasing, in its  
    entirety, with a new Section II.E. as set forth below:  
  
    E.  Property Acquisition and Leasing  
  
    1.   Policy.  
  
    a.  Acquisition Policy.    The Acquisition Policy is as follows:  The  
    University may purchase property within the City of Seattle.  
    University use and development of acquired property in the City of  
    Seattle must conform to the City of Seattle's use and development  
    regulations.  
  
    b.  Leasing Policy.    The Leasing Policy is as follows:  
  
    (1)  Permitted Leasing:  Notwithstanding any provision of the  
    University of Washington Master Plan, Seattle Campus, and conditions  
    of its approval, the University of Washington may lease any property  
    within the City of Seattle, subject to all of the following:  
  
    a)   Permitted Leasing Focus:  While the University may lease any  
    property within the City of Seattle, within the Primary and Secondary  
    Impact Zones it will work toward directing 75% of its leasing in the  
    Impact Zones to the University District Northwest Urban Center  
    Village (UDNUCV) as defined by the City's Comprehensive Plan and  
    shown on the attached map. (Attachment 1);  
  
    b)  In 2008, five years after adoption of this first amendment to the  
    City-University Agreement, the City and the University shall conduct  
    a review of UW off-campus leasing;  
  
    c)  Using the University District Market Analysis (Gardner/Johnson  
    May 2, 2003) as a baseline, the City and the University shall  
    consider the condition of the University market area by analyzing the  
    following factors: the number of housing units created as compared to  
    the City's Comprehensive Plan Housing Goals for the UDNUCV, the  
    number of University created jobs in the UDNUCV as compared to the  
    City's Comprehensive Plan Jobs goal, the amount of UW lease payments  
    to landlords within the UDNUCV, the economic contribution to  
    businesses within the UDNUCV by UW employees, the contribution of UW  
    academic capital to residents and businesses within the UDNUCV,  
    whether or not there have been impacts upon the commercial and  
    residential real estate markets or the on character of commercial  
    areas, and whether or not there has been active encouragement by the  
    University to influence the production of market-rate housing in the  
    UDNUCV, the extent to which the permitted leasing focus has been  
    achieved, and the extent to which the University has meaningfully  
    participated in the development and implementation of the  
    revitalization plan for the University District called for by City of  
    Seattle Resolution 30605;  
  
    d)  Based on the analysis conducted pursuant to "b)" and "c)"above,  
    the City and the University will determine whether or not UW leasing,  
    and/or the permitted leasing focus, of off-campus leasing within the  
    UDUNCV shall be continued or modified after 2010;  
  
    e)  UW off-campus leases shall continue to be permitted without  
    limit, unless limits are established through amendment to this City-  
    University Agreement;  
  
    f)  No leasing shall be allowed at the street level in a commercial  
    zone, except for uses similar to retail sales and services, customer  
    service offices, entertainment use, child care centers, medical  
    clinics, extension service offices or other uses permitted under the  
    Master Plan or in a Council-approved neighborhood plan, and only to  
    the extent such uses are also permitted by the underlying City  
    development regulations;  
  
    g) Except as permitted in an adopted master plan, within the  
    University District Northwest Urban Center Village (UDNUCV), the use  
    of leased space by the University shall neither result in the  
    demolition of a structure(s) that contains a residential use nor  
    change a residential use to a nonresidential use, unless such use is  
    replaced with comparable use within the UDNUCV.  Comparable use shall  
    be defined to be the number of units and comparable price to those  
    demolished; and  
  
    h) The University will develop a housing quality complaint program  
    for students using UW services to find off-campus, private housing,  
    within University District residential areas, including University  
    Park, beginning with information to students about DCLU code  
    compliance, tenants' rights, landlord/tenant issues and mediation  
    services among others.  This program will be implemented in the 2004-  
    05 academic year.  The University will also complete the "Guide to  
    Student Community Relations - Neighbor to Neighbor Expectations" as  
    outlined in the Regents' response to the City Council's preliminary  
    Campus Master Plan decision.  This guide will be complete by the fall  
    of 2003 and mailed to students living in off-campus, private housing,  
    within University District residential areas, including University  
    Park.  
  
    (2)  The University will limit its real property leasing to  
    University programs that cannot reasonably be accommodated within  
    existing University facilities.  Prior to considering leasing or  
    rental agreements, the University will make reasonable attempts to  
    locate academic and research activities within available and suitable  
    University facilities. When existing facilities are not available or  
    suitable, the University will make reasonable attempts to lease in  
    areas where the University-related activity is a use compatible with  
    the existing uses in the area.  
  
    (3)  Use and development of leased space will comply with City of  
    Seattle land use regulations.  
  
    2.  Master Plan Amendments.  Amendments to the University's Master  
    Plan will not be required for land acquisition and leasing.  
  
    IV.  Creation of a New Section II.H.   The parties intend that the  
    following section be added to the agreement to reflect the joint  
    commitment by the City and the University to promote and encourage  
    new housing development within the UDNUCV as set forth below:  
  
    H.   Housing Goals  
  
    1. The City and the University have a shared interest in, and are  
    committed to using their unique positions to stimulate, the creation  
    of additional market-rate housing in the UDNUCV, consistent with the  
    Comprehensive Plan and the goals and objectives outlined in the  
    University Community Urban Center Plan.  The University is committed  
    to work with private developers to encourage the creation of mixed-  
    use projects that include market-rate rental, and for-sale, housing  
    and to stimulate additional housing opportunities for UW faculty and  
    staff.  The City is committed to reviewing its zoning regulations and  
    examining strategies for providing incentives for housing production.  
  
    2. The City and the University recognize that the primary housing  
    goals of the University Community Urban Center Plan are to: (1)  
    provide housing for a mix of demographic and income groups; (2)  
    encourage a stable residential population; and (3) enhance  
    neighborhood design quality and compatibility by using a variety of  
    strategies including development partnerships, zoning modifications,  
    financing subsidies and cost-reduction measures. Both parties agree  
    that providing additional urban housing and increasing long-term  
    residential stakeholders will promote neighborhood stability and  
    investment and establish additional market opportunities for retail  
    and service businesses.  
  
    3. The University has multiple interests in having housing options  
    available for faculty and staff in close proximity to the University.  
    Such housing would serve to minimize transportation impacts and  
    assist in the recruitment and retention of key personnel. The  
    University's presence and influence in the economy of the UDNUCV  
    affords it a unique ability to encourage the development of housing  
    to serve UW faculty and staff and other potential long-term  
    residential stakeholders.   The University will continue its efforts,  
    to the extent allowed by law, to provide housing financing  
    opportunities for its faculty and staff including but not limited to,  
    programs such as the Hometown Homeloan Program.  The University will  
    report to the City on its efforts to stimulate new housing production  
    and development of housing options for faculty and staff as outlined  
    in Section II.D.2. of this Agreement.  
  
    4. As the City reviews zoning regulations within the UDNUCV, it will  
    work to eliminate barriers to housing development and may provide  
    incentives for the creation of additional housing units.
