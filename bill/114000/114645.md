    not apply to the sale of Parcel H.  
  
    Section 5.  The City Council anticipates that approximately Three  
    Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000) of the funds to be received from  
    King County as authorized in Section 2 will be used for the  
    development at Smith Cove of an unlit grass ballfield for use  
    primarily by children.  It is the Council's intent, however, that no  
    development of that ballfield occur until the Department of Parks and  
    Recreation has presented its proposed plan for that ballfield's  
    development at community meetings and has received and considered  
    comments from the community.  The Council therefore requests that the  
    Superintendent of Parks and Recreation or his designee report to the  
    Council's Parks, Education and Libraries Committee or its functional  
    successor on that community process and the final plan for that  
    ballfield's development before commencing construction.  
  
    Section 6.  Any act consistent with the authority and prior to the  
    effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.  
  
    Section 7.  The foregoing appropriations are made to meet actual  
    necessary expenditures of the City for which insufficient  
    appropriation has been made due to causes that could not reasonably  
    have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the 2003 Budget.  
    Now, therefore, in accordance with RCW 35.32A.060, by reason of the  
    facts above stated, this ordinance shall take effect and be in force  
    thirty (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not  
    approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after  
    presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code  
    Section 1.04.020.

        5.1 FINDING OF SUITABILITY FOR TRANSFER.  Seller has completed an  
    Environmental Baseline Survey (EBS) to examine the Property for  
    hazardous substances.  Based on the EBS, Seller has taken appropriate  
    remedial action and has determined that the Property is suitable for  
    transfer; said decision has been set forth in a Finding of Suitability  
    for Transfer (FOST).  Purchaser acknowledges that copies of the EBS  
    and FOST referred to above have been made available to the Purchaser.  
  
      5.2 FINDING OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.  Seller has completed an  
    Environmental Assessment (EA) of the Property in accordance with the  
    National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to examine the environmental  
    impact of Seller conveying the Property to Purchaser that has resulted  
    in a Finding of No Significant (FONSI).  Purchaser acknowledges that  
    copies of the EA and FONSI referred to above have been made available  
    to Purchaser.  
  
    6.    PURCHASER'S CONDITIONS.  Purchaser's obligation to close this  
    transaction is subject to fulfillment of the conditions precedent  
    ("Purchaser's Conditions Precedent") described below, or waiver  
    thereof by Purchaser, on or before date of closing as provided in  
    Section 7.1.  The Purchaser's Conditions Precedent are solely for the  
    benefit of Purchaser and may be waived only in writing by Purchaser.  
    Purchaser shall at all times have the right to waive any condition.  
    The waiver by Purchaser of any condition in any specific circumstances  
    shall not be a waiver of such condition with respect to any other  
    circumstances or a waiver of any other condition and shall not relieve  
    Seller of any liability or obligation with respect to any  
    representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller, unless the  
    waiver expressly so provides. If any Purchaser's Condition Precedent  
    is not timely fulfilled and is not waived by Purchaser, Purchaser may  
    terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller, and Escrow Agent  
    shall, if Purchaser so instructs, return to the Parties all funds and  
    documents deposited by them, respectively with Escrow Agent and the  
    parties shall have no further rights or obligations with respect to  
    this Agreement.

    passed by the Seattle City Council and signed by the Mayor,  
    authorizing the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and  
    appropriating funds to complete this transaction.  
  
    6.2 TITLE.  The Title Company shall be prepared to issue the title  
    policy described in Section 4.2.  
  
    7.  CLOSING.  
  
        7.1 TIME FOR CLOSING; TERMINATION DATE.  Unless otherwise agreed  
    to in writing, it is intended by both the Seller and Purchaser that  
    this transaction be closed at the earliest possible date, but in no  
    event later than August 31, 2003, which is the termination date of  
    this Agreement, and no sooner than the effective date of the ordinance  
    described in Section 6.1 above.  Purchaser and Seller will deposit in  
    escrow with Escrow Agent all instruments, documents, monies necessary  
    to complete the sale in accordance with this Agreement.  As used in  
    this Agreement, "closing" or "date of closing" means the date on which  
    all appropriate documents are recorded and proceeds of sale are  
    available for disbursement to Seller.  Funds held in reserve accounts  
    pursuant to escrow instructions shall be deemed, for purposes of this  
    definition, as available for disbursement to Seller.  
  
      7.2 PRORATIONS; CLOSING COSTS.  Real property taxes and special  
    district charges, which include surface water management (SWM) and  
    conservation fees, for the current year and any delinquent years, if  
    applicable, will be paid in full by Purchaser and shall not be  
    prorated as of the date of closing.  The Purchaser will pay the  
    premium for its owner's standard ALTA policy of title insurance and  
    the Escrow Agent's escrow fee.  Seller and Purchaser expect that this  
    transaction is exempt from payment of Washington State Real Estate  
    Excise Tax, pursuant to WAC 458-61-420 (Government Transfer).  
  
    8.   DEFAULT.  Time is of the essence of this Agreement.  If Seller  
    has performed all of Seller's covenants and obligations under this  
    Agreement, title is insurable as provided in Section 4.2, Seller's  
    representations are true and accurate, Purchaser's conditions are  
    satisfied or waived, and Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the  
    Property through no fault of the Seller, the Deposit will be forfeited  
    to Seller and Purchaser will have no further obligations or liability  
    under this Agreement.  If Seller is unable to (or does not) perform  
    its covenants and obligations under this Agreement, if title is not  
    insurable as provided in Section 4.2, or if Seller's representations  
    are not all true and accurate, Escrow Agent will return the Deposit  
    with accrued interest to Purchaser upon demand by Purchaser.  
  
    9.  OFFICIALS NOT TO BENEFIT.  No member or delegate to the congress  
    or resident commissioner shall be admitted to any share or part of the  
    contract sale or to any benefit that may arise therefrom, but this  
    provision shall not be construed to extend to the contract of sale if  
    made with a corporation for its general benefit.  
  
    10.  PARTIES RIGHTS.  The failure of either party to insist upon or  
    enforce strict performance by the other party of any provision of, or  
    to exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be construed as a  
    waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such party's right to assert  
    or rely upon any such provision in any other instance; rather the same  
    shall remain in full force and effect.  
  
    11.  LEGAL FEES.  The Parties agree that each will be responsible for  
    its own legal fees related to the conduct and closing of this  
    transaction, including any future litigation resulting from or arising  
    out of this transaction. In no case will the Seller be expected or  
    asked to pay or reimburse the Purchaser for legal fees and/or cost  
    incurred by them resulting from or arising out of this transaction and  
    in no case will the Purchaser be expected or asked to pay or reimburse  
    the Seller for legal fees and/or cost incurred by them resulting from  
    or arising out of this transaction.  
  
    12.  NOTICES.  All notices, waivers, elections, approvals and demands

    shall remain locked at all times (keys shall be made available to  
    Purchaser at closing) to provide temporary security measures for the  
    residence located on USA Property.  From and after the date that  
    Purchaser installs the Fence, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion,  
    remove the existing fence located on Parcel F, unlock such existing  
    fence, change the lock on such existing fence or take any other action

    desirable.  
  
    13.2 No later than one (1) year after the date of closing, Purchaser  
    shall install at Purchaser's expense a new electric residential  
    utility service line from Seattle City Light's electric distribution  
    system in W Marina Place across USA Property to the existing residence  
    located on USA Property ("Electric Line").  Seller shall thereafter be  
    responsible for all costs associated with the Electric Line including,  
    without limitation, costs of maintenance, repair and replacement of  
    the Electric Line.  
  
    13.3 No later than one (1) year after the date of closing, Purchaser  
    shall install at Purchaser's expense a new residential domestic water  
    utility service line from Seattle Public Utilities' (SPU's) domestic  
    water main in W Galer Street under USA Property to the existing  
    residence located on USA Property ("Water Line").  The Water Line  
    shall have sufficient flow to supply the residence and its existing  
    adjacent fire hydrant on USA Property.  Seller shall thereafter be  
    responsible for all costs associated with the Water Line including,  
    without limitation, costs of maintenance, repair and replacement of  
    the Water Line.  
  
    13.4 Upon Purchaser's completion of the work described in Sections  
    13.2 and 13.3, Seller shall execute a quit claim deed to Purchaser  
    relinquishing all of Seller's rights in and to the utility easements  
    for water and electric service that are reserved to Seller in the quit  
    claim deed for Parcels E and F, the form of which is attached hereto  
    as Exhibit "C-2".  
  
    14.  GENERAL.  This is the entire agreement of Purchaser and Seller  
    with respect to the Property and supersedes all prior agreements  
    between them, written or oral.  This Agreement may be modified only in  
    writing, signed by Purchaser and Seller.  Any waivers under this  
    Agreement must be in writing.  A waiver of any right or remedy in the  
    event of a default will not constitute a waiver of such right or  
    remedy in the event of any subsequent default. This Agreement is for  
    the benefit of, and binding upon, Purchaser and Seller and their  
    successors and assigns.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any  
    provision of this Agreement will not affect the validity or  
    enforceability of any other provision.  This Agreement shall be  
    governed by the law of the State of Washington to the extent that the  
    United States has waived its sovereign immunity to such law.  
  
    15.  SIGNATURE IN COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed by the  
    Parties in counterparts and together such counterparts shall  
    constitute a single document.  
  
    16.  SURVIVAL.  The covenants, agreements, representations and  
    warranties made in this Agreement shall survive closing unimpaired and  
    shall not merge into the deeds and the recordation thereof.

    made available to Grantee and are each incorporated herein by  
    reference.  
  
    2.  ENVIRONMENTAL COVENANTS.  The United States of America, in  
    accordance with 42 USC 9620(h), hereby covenants and warrants to the  
    Grantee, its successors and assigns, that (1) all remedial action  
    necessary to protect human health and the environment with respect to  
    any hazardous substance remaining on the Property has been taken  
    before the date of this deed and (2) any additional remedial action  
    found to be necessary after this date shall be conducted by the United  
    States of America, acting by and through the Department of the Navy.  
    The United States of America, acting by and through the Department of

    3.  In connection with Grantor's covenant made in paragraph 2, the  
    Grantee agrees on behalf of itself, its successors and assigns, as a  
    covenant running with the land, that  
  
    Grantor, and its officers, agents, employees, contractors and  
    subcontractors, shall have the right, upon reasonable notice to  
    Grantee, its successors and assigns, to enter upon the Property in any  
    case in which a response or corrective action is found to be necessary  
    at such Property after the date of this deed.

    operate, maintain or undertake any other response or corrective action  
    as required or necessary including, but not limited to, monitoring  
    wells, pumping wells and treatment facilities.  Any such entry,  
    including such activities, response or corrective actions, shall be  
    coordinated with the Grantee or its successors and assigns, and shall  
    be performed in a manner which minimizes a) any damage to any  
    structures on the Property and, b) any disruption or disturbance of  
    the use and enjoyment of the Property.  The Grantor shall be  
    responsible, to the extent provided in the Federal Tort Claims Act,  
    for any personal injury or property damage or claims, suits or  
    penalties related to Grantor's environmental activities on the  
    property.  
  
    5.  Except for Grantor's responsibilities, if any, arising from  
    paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above, the Grantee accepts the Property in its  
    condition at the time of conveyance.  The recording of this deed on  
    behalf of the Grantee shall be conclusive evidence of the Grantees  
    acceptance of both this deed, and the condition of all property  
    conveyed hereby.  
  
    6.  GRANTEE COVENANTS for itself, its heir, successors, and assigns  
    and every successor in interest to the property hereby conveyed, or  
    any part thereof, that the said Grantee and such heirs, successors,  
    and assigns shall not discriminate upon the basis of race, color,  
    religion, or national origin in the practices conducted thereon. This  
    covenant shall not apply, however, to the lease or rental of a room or  
    rooms within a family dwelling unit; nor shall it apply with respect  
    to religion to premises used primarily for religious purposes. The  
    United States of America shall be deemed a beneficiary of this  
    covenant without regard to whether it remains the owner of any land or  
    interest therein in the locality of the property hereby conveyed and  
    shall have the sole right to enforce this covenant in any court of  
    competent jurisdiction.
