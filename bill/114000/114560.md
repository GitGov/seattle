    THIS PROPERTY USE AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is  
    executed this _____ day of ______, 2003 in favor of the City of  
    Seattle, a Washington municipal corporation (the "City"), by the  
    Seattle Housing Authority (the "Owner"), a Washington municipal  
    corporation, owner of property legally described herein (the  
    "Property").  
  
    RECITALS  
  
    A. The Owner has a fee simple and/or substantial beneficial interest  
    in the Property known as the High Point Garden Community in Seattle at  
    6550 32nd Avenue S.W., which is legally described in Attachment 1.  
  
    B. The Owner filed a petition (C.F. 305400) with the City for a  
    contract rezone to rezone the Property from Lowrise 1 (L1) to a  
    combination of Lowrise 2 (L2), Lowrise 4 (L4) and Neighborhood  
    Commercial 2 with a forty-foot height limit (NC2-40'), as shown on the  
    rezone map on Attachment 2, subject to conditions.  The purpose of the  
    application is to allow the Owner to redevelop the High Point Garden  
    Community under a federal HOPE VI grant with a mix of residential and  
    commercial uses.  
  
    C. Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) Section 23.34.004 allows the City to  
    approve a contract rezone subject to "self-imposed restrictions upon  
    the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse  
    impacts which could occur from unrestricted use and development  
    permitted in the zone."  
  
    D. On December 19, 2002, the Director of the Department of Design,  
    Construction and Land Use ("DCLU") recommended that the rezone be  
    granted, subject to conditions.  
  
    E. On March 5, 2003, the Hearing Examiner recommended that the rezone  
    be granted, subject to conditions.  
  
    F. On May 19, 2003, the City Council Committee of the Whole voted to  
    recommend to the full Council that the rezone be granted, subject to  
    conditions.  
  
    AGREEMENT  
  
    Section 1.  Pursuant to SMC 23.34.004, the Owner hereby covenants,  
    bargains and agrees, on behalf of itself and its successors and  
    assigns, that it will comply with the following limitations and  
    conditions in consideration of the rezone of the Property from L1 to  
    L2, L4 and NC2-40':  
  
    1. The changes in zone designation are granted as shown in Attachment  
    2, as limited in this Agreement and in the ordinance approving the  
    contract rezone.  Development of each block listed below is further  
    limited as follows:  
  
    a. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the Property is  
    1,600 dwelling units, regardless of whether the density permitted  
    under this Agreement or permitted under the applicable zone  
    designation for any given block is higher.  
  
    b. The following blocks are zoned Lowrise 4 (L4):  Blocks 1.3-1.4,  
    3.2, 4.1, 8, 10-13, 16-19, 21-24, 26-31, and 33.2-33.3.  The density  
    on these blocks is limited to the following density:  1 dwelling  
    unit/1,200 s.f. of lot area.  With the exception of the density limits  
    noted here and in subsection 1a, above, all other L4 development  
    standards apply to these blocks.  The height on these blocks is  
    limited to the L4 height limits.  
  
    c. The following blocks are zoned L4 and are subject to L4 density,  
    height limits and development standards:  Blocks 5, 14-15, 20, 32, and  
    34.2-34.4. (The changes in zone designation do not include the  
    requested departure from height for Block 14.)  
  
    d. The following blocks are zoned Lowrise 2 (L2) and are subject to L2  
    density and development standards:  Blocks 1.1-1.2, 2-3.1, B, 9.1-9.3,  
    25, 33.1, and 34.5-34.6.  
  
    e. The following block is zoned Neighborhood Commercial 2 with a  
    forty-foot height limit (NC2-40') and is subject to the NC2-40'  
    development standards, including the NC2-40' standards for heights:  
    Block 9.4-9.8.  
  
    f. Uses are limited as follows:  Block 5A, Library; Block 5B, Health  
    Center; Block 15, Community Park; and Block 20, Neighborhood Center.  
  
    2. To the extent permitted by Conditions 1 and 2 above, the changes in  
    zone designation are established only for the development of buildings  
    with substantially the same design and platting pattern as represented  
    in the applicant's Building Concept Plan (Sheet A2.0), Proposed  
    Contract Rezone (Sheet A3.0), and Proposed Block Zoning (Sheet A3.1),  
    dated October 31, 2002, including the same amenities and improvements  
    as represented in these and other plan sheets from the October 31,  
    2002 plans and as modified by additional City review and shown in the  
    plans presented at the hearing on February 10, 2003.  (Copies of  
    Sheets A2.0, A3.0 and A3.1 are attached as Attachments 3, 4, and 5.)  
    The Council acknowledges that SHA may refine the Building Concept Plan  
    (Sheet A2.0) as to building type, design and location on the lot to  
    reflect the evolution of the Building Concept as it continues through  
    the public review process through continuing community and SHA input,  
    design review and design development.  
  
    3. A unit/building count map shall be prepared and updated prior to  
    the submittal of applications for either future construction or with  
    building permits, whichever occurs first, at least quarterly, and  
    submitted to DCLU.  DCLU shall maintain the unit/building count map  
    and shall evaluate any proposed new uses or development to ensure that  
    the restrictions, particularly those on density limits, contained in  
    this PUDA are complied with.  
  
    4. SHA shall include the following language in Conditions, Covenants  
    and Restrictions for High Point, which shall be binding on all  
    purchasers of any portion of the Property:  "...each prospective Owner  
    is responsible for becoming apprised of the then most current Density  
    Chart prior to acquiring any portion of the Property.  Whenever any  
    portion of the Property is conveyed, the deed shall expressly refer to  
    the Density Restrictions and identify the maximum number of units that  
    may be developed, constructed and operated on the property that is  
    being conveyed by such deed."  
  
    5. SHA shall prepare Design Guidelines based on the Citywide Design  
    Manual and the Conditions, Covenants and Restrictions for High Point.  
    The Design Guidelines should be reviewed by the City's Design Review  
    Board to confirm consistency with Citywide Design Guidelines and  
    Design Review Board Guidance rendered for the High Point  
    Redevelopment.  The Design Guidelines shall be made part of the  
    Conditions, Covenants and Restrictions made binding on all purchasers  
    of any portion of the Property.  Design review shall be required to  
    the extent mandated by the Seattle Municipal Code, with the following  
    exceptions.  To ensure that proposed development is not "piecemealed"  
    in such a fashion as to inappropriately avoid design review, any  
    developer who develops in excess of eight units on a single block or  
    adjacent blocks will be subject to design review even if those  
    developments individually do not exceed eight units and are not  
    otherwise contiguous to each other.  Design review shall also be  
    required for commercial uses, mixed-uses and minor institutional uses  
    on the Property, and for all uses on Block 25.  
  
    6. On Block 25, a minimum setback is required along the west property  
    line, a maximum front yard setback is required for uses on Block 25  
    and no alley access shall be required.  The appropriate setbacks will  
    be determined through administrative design review, which is required  
    for the Block 25.  
  
    7. SHA must install all required streets, utilities and other  
    infrastructure prior to occupancy of any development site with the  
    exception that the final lift of asphalt may be completed at a later  
    time.  The development frontage street must have final pavement not  
    more than 18 months after the development of each phase is occupied.  
    Street trees shall be installed within 4 months of the final lift of  
    asphalt for each phase.  
  
    8. SHA or its developer partners are financially responsible for any  
    time spent by DCLU in connection with this Contract Rezone and the  
    implementation of rezone conditions.  
  
    9. SHA must comply with the Replacement Housing Plan for High Point  
    (SHA Board Resolution 4659, adopted September 16, 2002) contained in  
    the High Point Final EIS as Appendix H (a copy is attached to this  
    Agreement as Attachment 6).  
  
    Section 2.  This Agreement shall be recorded in the records of King  
    County by the City Clerk.  The covenants hereof shall be deemed to  
    attach to and run with the Property and shall be binding upon the  
    Owner, its heirs, successors and assigns, and shall apply to after-  
    acquired title of the Owner of the Property; provided the covenants  
    herein and the rezone shall expire and be of no force and effect ten  
    (10) years from the effective date of the approval of this rezone, or,  
    if construction permits have been applied for or issued at that time,  
    until expiration of those permits.  
  
    Section 3.  This Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement  
    between the Owner and the City; provided, such amendment agreement  
    shall be approved by the City Council by ordinance.  Nothing in this  
    Agreement shall prevent the City Council from making such further  
    amendments to the zoning ordinance and/or Land Use Code or exercising  
    the City's police power, as it may deem necessary in the public  
    interest.  The conditions contained in this Agreement are based on the  
    unique circumstances applicable to this Property, and this Agreement  
    is not intended to establish precedent for other rezones in the  
    surrounding area.  
  
    Section 4.  This Agreement is made for the benefit of the City and for  
    the benefit of the owners of the property within 300 feet of the  
    Property and either the City or any such property owners may institute  
    and prosecute any proceeding at law or in equity to enforce this  
    Agreement.  
  
    Section 5.  The Owner acknowledges that compliance with the  
    conditions of this Agreement is a condition of the subject rezone and  
    that if the Owner avails itself of the benefits of this rezone but  
    then fails to comply with the conditions of this Agreement with the  
    City, in addition to pursuing any other remedy, the City may revoke  
    the rezone by ordinance and require the use of the Property to conform  
    to the requirements of the previously existing Lowrise 1 zone.
