    AN ORDINANCE relating to defeasing certain taxable 1994 bonds of the  
    City; authorizing a transfer from the City's Cumulative Reserve  
    Subfund REET I Subaccount to the Defeasance Account in the Bond Fund  
    for the City's outstanding Limited Tax General Obligation Bonds, 1994  
    (Taxable); and appropriating that amount from that Defeasance Account  
    to carry out the Defeasance Plan with respect to those bonds.  
  
    WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 117050, passed by the City Council on  
    February 14, 1994, and Resolution 28895, adopted by the City Council  
    on March 17, 1994 (collectively, the "1994 Bond Legislation"), The  
    City of Seattle, Washington (the "City"), heretofore issued its  
    $73,400,000 par value Limited Tax General Obligation Bonds, 1994  
    (Taxable) (the "1994 Bonds"), dated March 1, 1994, and by that 1994  
    Bond Legislation reserved the right to redeem the 1994 Bonds prior to  
    their maturity on October 1, 2004, at a price of 102% of par plus  
    accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption; and  
  
    WHEREAS, pursuant to the 1994 Bond Legislation, the City reserved the  
    right to use money available from any lawful source to pay when due  
    the principal of and interest on the 1994 Bonds, or any portion  
    thereof included in a defeasance plan; and  
  
    WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 120864 (the "Defeasance Ordinance"),  
    the City determined that to reduce costs of the City during a period  
    of economic downtown and reduced tax revenues, it is in the best  
    interest of the City and its taxpayers to budget funds of the City  
    from time to time to provide for the defeasance of all or a portion of  
    the outstanding 1994 Bonds by placing in escrow amounts that, if  
    invested in direct obligations of the United States of America, will  
    be sufficient to provide the funds required to pay principal of,  
    premium, if any, and interest on the 1994 Bonds selected for  
    defeasance when due or when optionally redeemed, thereby effecting a  
    savings in debt service to the City (the "Defeasance Plan"); and  
  
    WHEREAS, pursuant to the Defeasance Ordinance, the City established a  
    Defeasance Account in the Bond Fund for the 1994 Bonds, authorized the  
    Director of Finance to enter into a Defeasance Trust Agreement and  
    Addenda thereto from time to time (together, the "Defeasance Trust  
    Agreement") with The Bank of New York (the "Defeasance Trustee") to  
    carry out the Defeasance Plan, and appropriated certain amounts from  
    the Defeasance Account to the Defeasance Trustee to acquire certain  
    Initial Escrow Obligations for the Defeasance Plan; and  
  
    WHEREAS, pursuant to the Defeasance Ordinance and the Defeasance Trust  
    Agreement, the Director of Finance has identified additional 1994  
    Bonds to be defeased, and it is necessary to transfer an additional  
    amount to the Defeasance Account and appropriate that amount to the  
    Defeasance Trustee to acquire Additional Escrow Obligations for the  
    Defeasance Plan; NOW THEREFORE,
