    shall work in close cooperation with the City during the preparation  
    of preliminary and final plans for the Project to ensure that, to the  
    greatest extent possible, the objectives identified in the April 20,  
    1998 MOA and this Fifth Supplement are achieved.  
  
    3.1. Level of Completion Defined.  
  
    Each level of design completion as used in this Fifth Supplement and  
    its Exhibits shall be defined as follows.  
  
    3.1.1. 30%-Complete Submittal - A submittal that presents the basic  
    concept of the Project, including advanced detail on route alignment;  
    station locations; station functional layouts and preliminary station  
    architectural concepts; existing utilities and proposed major utility  
    line re-locations; traffic lane configurations; structural types,  
    sizes and locations; urban design concepts; new and proposed right-of-  
    way limits; extent of roadway modifications; and other supporting  
    concepts to define the intent of the Project. The submittal will  
    include technical memoranda documenting trade off studies undertaken  
    in support of the proposed design.  
  
    3.1.2. 60%-Complete Submittal - A submittal that is sufficiently  
    complete to illustrate the entire scope of the work under design so  
    that all reviewers can comment on the overall scope of the Project.  
    This submittal shall also include an updated cost estimate. (This  
    submittal is intended to ensure that new, never before seen items of  
    significance do not appear for the first time in the 90%-Complete  
    Submittal, excepting new design generated in response to 60%  
    comments.)  
  
    3.1.3. 90%-Complete Submittal - The submittal that includes drawings,  
    special provisions, supplemental technical specifications,  
    geotechnical data, updated quantity estimates, and order of magnitude  
    cost estimates that are essentially complete with only items of  
    insignificance needing detailing or checking.  All calculations shall  
    be completed and checked in accordance with established quality  
    control procedures.  The structural calculations need not be sent to  
    the City, but will be made available to the City for review at the  
    City's request. Drawings shall be nearly complete for bidding purposes  
    and shall have incorporated or resolved all comments made during  
    previous design reviews.  Unresolved comments shall be identified and  
    addressed to the satisfaction of both Parties.  
  
    3.1.4. 100%-Complete Submittal.  The submittal that is sufficiently  
    complete for the City's permit approval as confirmed by Seattle  
    Department of Transportation in writing.  
  
    3.2.  City's Standard Plans and Specifications.  
  
    Except as further provided in this subsection, the City's Standard  
    Plans and Specifications, 2000 Edition, shall be used for all Project-  
    related work that either (a) affects existing or proposed City  
    infrastructure, or (b) affects, in any way, any utility or other  
    capital facility or asset that is currently owned or controlled by the  
    City or is expected to be maintained by the City.  When relevant new  
    code and technical requirements dictate revisions to the City's  
    Standard Plans and Specifications, 2000 Edition , the City will  
    provide Sound Transit with General Special Provisions (GSPs) for  
    incorporation into Sound Transit's contract documents.  
  
    3.3. Deviation from City's Standard Specifications.  
  
    3.3.1. The City's Designated Representative or another official  
    designated by the City, may permit, from time to time, a deviation  
    from the requirements of Subsection 3.2 whenever:  
  
    A. Sound Transit has requested such permission in writing and has  
    provided a justification for such request and an explanation for how  
    Sound Transit intends to address anticipated City concerns if such  
    permission were granted, either in whole or in part, and a commitment  
    to fund additional Project costs as required; and  
  
    B. The City's Designated Representative, or other official designated  
    by the City, has consulted and reached consensus among the head(s) or  
    designated representative(s) of each City department and office that  
    has an interest in the matter; and  
  
    C. Sound Transit's requested deviation from the City's Standard Plans  
    and Specifications, 2000 Edition, is deemed by such City department  
    and office heads or their designated representatives to be acceptable  
    under the circumstances; and  
  
    D. If necessary, the City's Designated Representative, or other  
    official designated by the City, has been authorized to grant such  
    permission, which permission shall be expressed in writing by the  
    City's Designated Representative or other official designated by the  
    City, and shall not be used as a precedent for future actions.  
  
    3.3.2. If any conflict is discovered between Sound Transit or City  
    work under this Fifth Supplement and a City ordinance or other law,  
    code or regulation, the City is legally obligated, and reserves the  
    right, notwithstanding any other provision in this Fifth Supplement,  
    to require changes to bring the Project work into compliance with any  
    applicable ordinance, law, code or regulations; provided that as  
    applied to the work to be completed under this Fifth Supplement, the  
    City's Standard Plans and Specifications, 2000 Edition, or a deviation  
    authorized pursuant to Section 3.3 shall control in the event of a  
    conflict between the City's Standard Plans and Specifications, 2000  
    Edition, and any subsequent revision to the City Standard Plans and  
    Specifications.  
  
    3.4. Sound Transit Link Standard Specifications.  
  
    Sound Transit has developed a set of Link Standard Specifications to  
    be used on each of the Sound Transit civil facilities construction  
    contracts.  Any contract specific modifications of the Link Standard  
    Specifications shall be accomplished by the preparation of Contract  
    Specifications.  The City shall review each Contract Specification  
    package as part of the detailed schedule summarized in Exhibit 1.  If  
    the City requests modifications to the Link Standard Specifications  
    for a particular contract under review, Sound Transit, in conjunction  
    with the City, shall make a determination whether the proposed  
    modification is made through Contract Specifications.  
  
    3.5. Submission and Review of Design Submittals  
  
    3.5.1. To expedite design submittal review and to improve product  
    quality, design review and coordination sessions will be held at least  
    on a bi-weekly basis throughout the design phase between affected City  
    departments and offices and Sound Transit.  
  
    3.5.2. To ensure the development of the highest quality system, and  
    the most cost-effective resolution of problems, all efforts will be  
    made to identify and resolve major design issues at the earliest  
    possible stage of design development.

    as follows:  
  
    3.6.1. Sound Transit shall submit Project submittals and  
    specifications to the City's Designated Representative, or other  
    official designated by the City, for review and comment by various,  
    appropriate City departments and offices.  Sound Transit shall submit  
    thirty-five (35) complete copies of each plan package. During 2003 and  
    2004, the City is scheduled to review plans at the 60%-, 90%- and  
    100%-Complete Submittal stages, as defined by this Fifth Supplement.  
    Plans shall be submitted in accordance with the City's CADD (Computer  
    Aided Design/Drafting) standards, unless otherwise agreed to by the  
    City.  
  
    3.7. For Sound Transit performed work:  
  
    3.7.1. Sound Transit or its consultants shall develop the actual  
    design plans and design documents for the Project.

    early stages of design development and throughout the design process.  
  
    3.7.3. Sound Transit shall establish and provide to the City's  
    Designated Representative a target schedule for submittals as soon as  
    such schedule is available.  
  
    3.7.4. Sound Transit shall notify the City's Designated Representative  
    fifteen (15) Working Days prior to anticipated plan submittal dates to  
    ensure that City staff can be reallocated to be dedicated to the  
    expeditious review of Sound Transit documents.  The City departments  
    shall be notified by the Designated Representative of the anticipated  
    plan submittal dates.  
  
    3.7.5. Sound Transit shall provide the City with a complete submittal  
    for the work to be done in each construction contract awarded by Sound  
    Transit.  If Sound Transit determines that it cannot or is unlikely to  
    meet its anticipated submittal dates, it shall deliver to the City's  
    Designated Representative Sound Transit's revised submittal schedule  
    as soon as possible after any delay is known or suspected.  
  
    3.8.  Immediate Notice of Incomplete or Inadequate Design Submittals  
  
    3.8.1. Each Party recognizes that the incompleteness or insufficiency  
    of any submittal may result in project delays and require additional  
    expenditures beyond the budgeted amounts for this Project.  To quickly  
    correct incomplete submittals, the City's Designated Representative or  
    other official designated by the City shall notify Sound Transit  
    immediately if any plan submittal is incomplete or provides  
    insufficient detail for City review. City reviewers will describe the  
    deficiencies in writing in sufficient detail to enable corrections to  
    be made by Sound Transit in a timely and cost effective manner.  
  
    3.9. City Review Schedule  
  
    3.9.1. City review shall begin with receipt of each complete submittal  
    from Sound Transit. The City shall have thirty-five (35) Working Days  
    to review the 30%-, 60%-, and 90%-Complete Submittals. If more than  
    one plan package is submitted during the same review period, the City  
    shall have forty-five (45) Working Days to review the materials and  
    Sound Transit shall prioritize these multiple plan packages according  
    to importance to Sound Transit's schedule.  
  
    3.9.2. If the City's review of any document is a critical path  
    activity on Sound Transit's design schedule, Sound Transit may request  
    that the City complete such review in less time than allowed above. In  
    such cases, Sound Transit shall identify the critical submittal as far  
    in advance as possible, and notify the City of the need for an  
    expedited review. The City's Designated Representative shall allocate  
    sufficient resources to accomplish the review within a mutually agreed  
    upon time period.  
  
    3.9.3. The City shall return significant comments to Sound Transit for  
    any submittal as soon as they are available, and to the greatest  
    extent possible, will accomplish reviews in fewer working days than  
    provided for in this Fifth Supplement.  
  
    3.10. Resolution of Inconsistencies and Consolidation of City  
    Responses to Design Submittals.  
  
    3.10.1. The City's Designated Representative, or other official  
    designated by the City, shall resolve any inconsistencies among review  
    comments by City departments and offices regarding the Project's  
    design submittals prior to the review comments being consolidated and  
    transmitted, in writing, to Sound Transit.  
  
    3.10.2. The City recognizes that inconsistent review comments usually  
    cause delay, result in added staff time for review, and may result in  
    unnecessary change orders or additional costs to the Project. The City  
    intends to provide consistent review comments.  If inconsistent  
    comments are discovered, the City will resolve the inconsistencies  
    immediately upon written notice from Sound Transit. The City will  
    promptly take corrective action to avoid any added costs to Sound  
    Transit as a result of such inconsistencies and avoid providing  
    similar inconsistent comments on future reviews.  
  
    3.11. Sound Transit Response to City Review Comments and Resolution of  
    Issues  
  
    3.11.1. The City will submit formal written comments consolidated by  
    Seattle Department of Transportation to Sound Transit for each of the  
    30%-, 60%-, 90%-Complete Submittals within the timeframe specified in  
    Section 3.9.  Sound Transit must address and respond to every written  
    comment submitted by the City. Depending on the number and magnitude  
    of comments by the City on the 90%-Complete Submittal, Sound Transit  
    shall work with City staff to resolve all issues through, among other  
    means, conducting one-on-one meetings, making additional plan sheet  
    revisions and obtaining approval by concurrence memos or meeting  
    minutes, conducting a key stakeholder group plan review session, or  
    advancing the issue to the next level of administration to resolve the  
    issues in a timely manner.  The Seattle Department of Transportation  
    shall notify Sound Transit in writing when all outstanding design  
    issues have been resolved based on the 90% - Complete Submittal  
    comments.  Both the City and Sound Transit shall work collaboratively  
    to get issues resolved in a timely manner prior to Sound Transit  
    delivering the 100%-Complete Submittal to the City for approval.  Plan  
    approval is a prerequisite to issuance of the Project Construction  
    Permit by Seattle Department of Transportation under the Agreement  
    Between  the City of Seattle and Sound Transit for Grant of Non-  
    Exclusive Use of a Light Rail Transit Way as Related to the Central  
    Link Light Rail Transit Project (authorized by Ordinance 119975).  
  
    3.11.2. Sound Transit must submit a one-week advance notice prior to  
    submitting the final 100% - Complete Submittal to Seattle  
    Transportation.  Sound Transit will submit three - 1/2 size plan sets  
    for final approval.  Seattle Department of Transportation will  
    coordinate a final check of the submittal and will provide written  
    concurrence if the 100% - Complete Submittal has adequately addressed  
    the City comments within 15 Working Days of receiving the three plan  
    sets.  
  
    3.11.3. When written notice of acceptance of the 100% - Complete  
    Submittal is given to Sound Transit, Seattle Department of  
    Transportation will invite Sound Transit to submit full-size vellums  
    of all the Drawings for signature.  
  
    3.11.4. The cost associated with generating the Project Construction  
    Permit is based on time and materials, which are reimbursed through  
    this, and previous, agreements. A final processing/filing fee of  
    $94.00 will be invoiced for each construction contract's Project  
    Construction Permit.  
  
    3.12. DCLU Review and Issuance of Permits  
  
    The City and Sound Transit will implement a fast track permit process  
    for DCLU construction and land use approvals. Permit applications to  
    DCLU shall be handled pursuant to the expedited permitting process  
    established by DCLU for handling Sound Transit permit applications.  
  
    4.0 PROJECT DESIGN TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS  
  
    Certain principles shall be applied by Sound Transit to the greatest  
    extent practicable to achieve certain goals of the City regarding  
    maintenance and operation of the facilities constructed by Sound  
    Transit.  These principles are discussed in the following subsections.  
  
    4.1. Minimize City Maintenance and Operational Costs  
  
    The Project shall be designed to the greatest extent practical to  
    minimize any increase in City maintenance and operation costs directly  
    caused by the Project.  Prior to the issuance of construction permits,  
    Sound Transit and the City shall develop formal agreements, in  
    accordance with overall policy direction established by the Sound  
    Transit Board and the City, to clearly delineate ongoing maintenance  
    and operational responsibilities that are likely to be experienced by  
    the City as a direct result of the Project or operation of the  
    resulting light rail system. Such issues and costs include but are not  
    limited to the reconstruction or realignment of any street, sidewalk,  
    bikeway or utility facility or system; the re-timing or other  
    modifications of existing traffic signals; and the installation of new  
    traffic signal, signage, lane markings, street lighting, sidewalk  
    lighting, or pathway lighting within the construction limits of the  
    Project.  
  
    4.2. Project Design to Minimize Travel and Access Disruptions  
  
    The Project shall be designed to the greatest extent practical to  
    minimize disruptions to City businesses and residents during  
    construction. To achieve that result, Sound Transit and the City shall  
    work cooperatively with representatives of businesses and  
    neighborhoods affected by the Project. The Project shall also be  
    designed to ensure that:  
  
    4.2.1. The number of streets in contiguous blocks that are closed or  
    permitted to have severely restricted vehicular or pedestrian traffic  
    during the Project's construction phase is minimized, either by  
    construction being undertaken at varying times of day, in geographic  
    stages, or through other means;  
  
    4.2.2. Emergency vehicle, utility maintenance vehicle and fire  
    protection vehicle access to every business and residence adjacent to  
    the Project construction area, and pedestrian access to each such  
    residence, and to each such business, during its normal business  
    hours, are preserved at all times;  
  
    4.2.3. Vehicular access for types of vehicles other than those  
    identified in Subsection 4.2.2  to every residence adjacent to the  
    Project construction area is preserved except when construction  
    requirements necessitate the complete blockage thereof; and  
  
    4.2.4. Reasonable prior notice is provided to directly affected  
    property owners, business tenants and neighborhood residents of any  
    loss or change of access to or from their respective properties,  
    tenancies and residences, indicating the expected duration of such  
    loss or change, and alternatives that are available to those affected  
    by such loss or change.  
  
    5.0 REIMBURSEMENTS  
  
    5.1. Sound Transit's Maximum Funding Obligation  
  
    Sound Transit's maximum funding obligation under this Fifth Supplement  
    for the reimbursable services described in Exhibit 2 shall be  
    $1,347,000.  Sound Transit shall not be obligated to reimburse any  
    expenditure in excess of the maximum amount stated in this section,  
    unless authorization is received from its Board of Directors and upon  
    the execution of a new supplement or an amendment of this Fifth  
    Supplement upon such terms and conditions as are approved by the  
    Board.  Should estimated costs at any time, for any reason, exceed the  
    amount covered by this Fifth Supplement, the City shall notify Sound  
    Transit without delay.  
  
    5.2. Budget  
  
    Sound Transit shall reimburse the City for services delivered and work  
    performed under the scope of work of this Fifth Supplement. The amount  
    set forth above and in the budget provided in Exhibit 3, which is  
    attached to this Fifth Supplement and incorporated herein by  
    reference, reflects the Parties' best estimates of the amounts that  
    may be required to accomplish the reimbursable tasks under this Fifth  
    Supplement.  Sound Transit and the City recognize that the cost of  
    delivering such services and performing such work have been estimated  
    based on assumptions stated in Exhibit 2 and information from each  
    Party, and the Parties recognize that the reallocation of effort based  
    on actual needs may be necessary should Sound Transit change planned  
    activities.  The City shall endeavor to manage the expenditures of  
    departments and offices engaged in work under this Fifth Supplement so  
    that the maximum obligation of Sound Transit is not exceeded.  
  
    5.3. Reimbursement of City Costs.  
  
    5.3.1. Principles for Determining Eligible Reimbursable Costs.  
  
    The following principles shall be applied to determine what costs are  
    reimbursable by Sound Transit.  
  
    * The costs are directly related to the Project and must be essential  
    to meeting Project objectives and schedule.  
  
    * Tasks must clearly add "essential value" to the Project.  
  
    * Tasks and the deliverable or product must be clearly described in  
    writing.  
  
    * The approach and system used to complete the task should be as  
    efficient and cost-effective as possible (even if it means doing  
    things differently).  
  
    * Tasks indirectly related to implementing the Link Light Rail Project  
    may be encouraged/supported by Sound Transit, but will not be funded  
    by Sound Transit.  
  
    * Tasks will not duplicate an activity already programmed or covered  
    by Sound Transit, another City department, a third party or consultant  
    where possible.  
  
    * Reimbursement will not be made for activities that are normally  
    performed by the City in conducting business with other entities in  
    connection with public projects, such as provision of information  
    and/or documents, review of Environmental Impact Statements, that the  
    City would normally perform without charge.  
  
    5.4. Reallocation of Unexpended Funds  
  
    Funds not expended by Sound Transit during the period of this Fifth  
    Supplement may be reallocated by Sound Transit to additional Central  
    Link Light Rail Project activities as defined in future supplements or  
    agreements.  
  
    5.5. Approval of Excess Expenditures  
  
    Sound Transit and the City agree to the following rules for increases  
    in Task Budgets:  
  
    A. The City may expend up to the estimated cost of each budgeted Task  
    delineated in Exhibit 3.  
  
    B. As a condition of payment of any costs in excess of the amount  
    shown for any of the budgeted Tasks provided in Exhibit 3, written  
    approval shall be requested by the City in a timely fashion, and  
    approval or disapproval shall be provided by Sound Transit in writing.  
    Written approval must be granted before the excess costs are incurred.  
  
    C. If unforeseen circumstances cause the projected total cost to  
    exceed the total cost of any Task, the City will take all prudent  
    steps to minimize costs and notify Sound Transit as soon as possible.  
  
    D. Upon receipt of notice from the City regarding unanticipated costs  
    or cost increases, Sound Transit shall promptly provide a written  
    response, which may (1) approve or reject the proposed increased  
    expenditure, (2) re-adjust the scope of work, or (3) authorize the use  
    of contingency amounts budgeted for this Fifth Supplement.  Any  
    expenditures that exceed the maximum amount authorized for this Fifth  
    Supplement shall require further authorization by Sound Transit's  
    Board of Directors.  
  
    5.6. Invoicing by City  
  
    The City will invoice Sound Transit on a quarterly basis based on  
    actual expenditures. Within thirty (30) calendar days after Sound  
    Transit's receipt of any complete and accurate City invoice, Sound  
    Transit shall remit the reimbursement for the amount of valid  
    expenditures.  
  
    5.7. Reimbursement by Sound Transit  
  
    Quarterly reimbursements for eligible expenditures under this Fifth  
    Supplement shall be made upon the satisfactory completion of the work.  
    The City shall initiate the process for reimbursement of its  
    expenditures by preparing, reviewing and submitting requests for  
    reimbursement to Sound Transit in accordance with the procedures in  
    this Subsection and any other applicable regulations provided to the  
    City's Designated Representative.  Sound Transit shall not transfer  
    nor be obligated to transfer any funds in advance of its approval of a  
    request for reimbursement of completed work.  
  
    All reimbursements shall be made under the following procedures:  
  
    5.7.1. Reimbursement of the eligible costs shall be made upon approval  
    by Sound Transit.  All work submitted shall be reasonably certified as  
    acceptable by Sound Transit before final payment.  
  
    5.7.2. To be entitled to reimbursement for the satisfactory  
    performance of the activities identified in this Agreement, the City  
    must provide documentation of all expenses eligible for reimbursement  
    to Sound Transit as required by this Fifth Supplement or by the  
    applicable federal requirements.  Sound Transit reserves the right to  
    withhold payments pending timely delivery and proper completion of the  
    reports or documents as may be required under this Fifth Supplement.  
  
    5.7.3. The City shall supply to Sound Transit an invoice of costs  
    incurred for the period and progress reports for each department  
    including departmental costs in total and by category and a  
    description of work performed.  
  
    5.7.4. Invoices shall bear the name and address of the City's  
    Designated Representative, and reference this Fifth Supplement.  
    Invoices must be signed by an authorized representative of the City  
    who shall verify that the invoice is accurate, the services have been  
    purchased or the work has been performed, and that the costs shown  
    have been reasonably incurred in accordance with this Fifth  
    Supplement.  Invoices shall be properly completed and accompanied with  
    documentation as required by Sound Transit.  
  
    5.8. Addresses for Invoicing and Reimbursement.  
  
    A. To secure payment the City shall submit all invoices, required  
    reports, and documentation to the Designated Representative of Sound  
    Transit at the address provided in or pursuant to Section 2.4.  
  
    B. Reimbursements will be paid directly to the City to the attention  
    of the Designated Representative of the City at the address provided  
    in or pursuant to Section 2.4.  
  
    6.0 ADMINISTRATION  
  
    6.1. Monitoring and Reporting of Progress  
  
    The City is committed to work efficiently and will closely monitor the  
    time required to complete work products consistent with the scope of  
    work and budget for the Project. The City shall provide clear,  
    accurate and detailed monthly progress reports to Sound Transit.  The  
    City shall work with Sound Transit to further refine its progress  
    reporting, accounting and program management system to ensure useful  
    and descriptive information that complements Sound Transit's Project  
    control system.   The City and Sound Transit shall provide active,  
    ongoing oversight to ensure that Sound Transit funds are expended  
    efficiently, in a manner that adds value to the Project.  
  
    6.2. Monitoring and Reporting of Costs  
  
    6.2.1. The City's Designated Representative, or other designated City  
    official, shall coordinate requests for reimbursements by all City  
    departments and offices and will provide cost reports to Sound Transit  
    on a quarterly basis.  In addition, Sound Transit may require other  
    financial documents to verify that the expenditures are related to the  
    Project work funded by this Agreement, including, but not limited to,  
    (1) work statements or payroll records, (2) invoices for materials and  
    supplies, (3) statements from professionals for services rendered,  
    (4) certifications by the City that materials and services are  
    satisfactorily rendered, and (5) itemized listings of the charges  
    supported by copies of original bills, invoices, expense accounts, and  
    miscellaneous supporting data retained by the City.  
  
    6.2.2. The City shall provide any plans, specifications, accounting  
    records or other documents needed to satisfy requests from federal  
    funding agencies for information to comply with Sound Transit's  
    funding requirements.  The City shall inspect all work performed under  
    this Agreement and ensure that payments requested for reimbursement  
    are eligible under this Agreement.  
  
    6.3. Reconciliation  
  
    Both Parties agree to monitor and reconcile the actual versus  
    estimated effort on a quarterly basis. The Parties will negotiate  
    additional funding or a reduction in services relating to the Project  
    to the extent that such work cannot be performed within the estimated  
    budget for the services delivered and work performed. Sound Transit  
    will rely on information contained in the City's progress reports to  
    identify changes in the work as reported on by the City in order to  
    have the opportunity to take corrective action or clarify assumed work  
    efforts. Notwithstanding the above, if the permit approval work  
    performed by DCLU (for which payment is to be on an hourly rate in  
    lieu of value-based construction permit fees) exceeds the estimated  
    amount, Sound Transit shall pay the additional charges without further  
    negotiations.  
  
    6.4. Availability of Records.  
  
    All project records in support of all costs incurred and actual  
    expenditures kept by the City shall be maintained in accordance with  
    procedures prescribed by the Washington State Auditor's Office and the  
    applicable Federal funding agencies. The records shall be open to  
    inspection by Sound Transit and the Federal government during normal  
    business hours, and shall be retained and made available for such  
    inspection for a period of not less than three years from the final  
    payment of any federal aid funds to the City. Copies of said records  
    shall be furnished to Sound Transit and/or the Federal government upon  
    request.  This requirement shall be included in all subcontracts  
    related to the work entered into by the City to fulfill the terms of  
    this Fifth Supplement.  
  
    6.5. Audit.  
  
    If an audit is requested by Sound Transit or required by any  
    applicable federal agency requirements, the City agrees to cooperate  
    fully with Sound Transit's auditor, any independent auditor chosen and  
    retained by Sound Transit for auditing expenditures under this Fifth  
    Supplement or previous Supplements, or with any audit required by the  
    federal funding agency, if applicable.  At the time of a federal  
    audit, if required, the City will provide documentation of all costs  
    incurred under this Fifth Supplement or previous supplements.  
  
    6.6. Third Party Contract Administration  
  
    Each Party shall be solely responsible for the administration of and  
    the completion and quality of work performed under any contracts  
    executed by the Party.  In no event shall any contract executed by a  
    Party be construed as obligating the other Party to this Fifth  
    Supplement.  All contracts shall comply with all applicable public  
    works and procurement laws and regulations, including, but not limited  
    to, bonding, prevailing wage, nondiscrimination, retainage, insurance,  
    and workers compensation requirements.  
  
    7.0 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS  
  
    The Parties remain committed to resolving issues cooperatively,  
    expeditiously, and at the lowest possible staff level. However, as  
    provided for in the April 20, 1998 MOA, the following is the agreed  
    upon process for dispute resolution:  
  
    7.1. General  
  
    The Designated Representatives will use their best efforts to resolve  
    disputes and issues arising out of or related to the tasks covered by  
    this Fifth Supplement. The Designated Representatives will communicate  
    regularly to discuss the status of the tasks to be performed and to  
    resolve any issues or disputes related to the successful performance  
    of this Fifth Supplement. The Designated Representatives will  
    cooperate in providing staff support to facilitate the performance of  
    this Fifth Supplement and the resolution of any issues or disputes  
    arising during the term of this Fifth Supplement.  
  
    7.2. Notice of Problem or Dispute and Meeting of Designated  
    Representatives  
  
    Each Designated Representative will notify the other in writing of any  
    problem or dispute that the Designated Representative believes should  
    be resolved. The Designated Representatives shall meet within three  
    (3) Working Days of receiving the written notice in an attempt to  
    resolve the dispute.  
  
    7.3. Meeting of Directors  
  
    In the event the Designated Representatives cannot resolve a dispute  
    (and that dispute is not subject to some other formal appeal process),  
    the Sound Transit Executive Director or his/her designee and the  
    Director of the Seattle Department of Transportation or his/her  
    designee shall meet within seven (7) Working Days of receiving notice  
    from a Designated Representative and engage in good faith negotiations  
    to resolve the dispute.  
  
    7.4. Prerequisites to Litigation  
  
    Neither Sound Transit nor the City shall have the right to seek relief  
    under this Fifth Supplement in a court of law until and unless each of  
    the procedural steps specified in Subsections 7.2 and 7.3 have been  
    completed.  
  
    8.0 COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.  
  
    8.1. Compliance.  
  
    The City agrees to comply with applicable federal funding requirements  
    of which it is specifically informed, in connection with its receipt  
    of funds from Sound Transit to perform certain tasks under the MOA and  
    its supplements.  
  
    8.2. Federal Contract Provisions.  
  
    The work performed by the City's contractors shall comply with federal  
    contract and funding requirements to the extent the City is notified  
    of federal grant requirements and to the extent federal funds are  
    utilized by the City under this Fifth Supplement.  All contracts  
    entered into by the City shall include such provisions as required by  
    the Federal Transit Administration ("FTA") to be included in third-  
    party contracts.  
  
    9.0 EXERCISE OF CITY'S POLICE POWER  
  
    Sound Transit recognizes the right vested in the City pursuant to  
    general law to exercise its police power for the protection of the  
    health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and their properties.  
    Nothing in this Fifth Supplement shall be construed as precluding the  
    City from exercising such power in connection with Sound Transit's  
    light rail system except as specifically provided in this Fifth  
    Supplement, and then, only to the extent this Fifth Supplement  
    expressly precludes such exercise.  
  
    10.0 PRIORITY FOR STATE OF EMERGENCY SITUATIONS  
  
    The time period required for performance of services under this Fifth  
    Supplement, other than due dates for payments for services rendered or  
    work performed by the City, shall be extended to include the length of  
    any delay caused by or resulting from the prohibition or restriction  
    of such action by the State or Federal government, or any fire,  
    earthquake, flood, storm, power failure, major equipment breakdown,  
    war, labor trouble, accident, riot, act of Nature, or other event  
    beyond the reasonable control of the Party obligated to perform such  
    services; provided, that the Party adversely affected by such  
    condition shall promptly advise the other Party, in writing, of the  
    occurrence of an event of force majeure and make a reasonable attempt  
    to satisfy its obligations hereunder notwithstanding the event of  
    force majeure.  
  
    11.0 LEGAL RELATIONS  
  
    11.1. Indemnification.  
  
    To the extent permitted by law, each Party to this Agreement shall  
    protect, defend, indemnify, and save harmless the other Party, and its  
    officers, officials, employees, and agents, while acting within the  
    scope of their employment, from any and all costs, claims, demands,  
    judgments, damages, or liability of any kind including injuries to  
    persons or damages to property, which arise out of, or in any way  
    result from, or are connected to, or are due to any negligent acts or  
    omissions of the indemnifying Party.  No Party shall be required to  
    indemnify, defend, or save harmless the other Party if the claim,  
    suit, or action for injuries, death, or damages is caused by the sole  
    negligence of the Party seeking indemnification.  Where such claims,  
    suits, or actions result from concurrent negligence of the Parties,  
    the indemnity provisions provided herein shall be valid and  
    enforceable only to the extent of the Party's own negligence.  Each  
    Party agrees that its obligations under this indemnification section  
    extend to any claim, demand, and/or cause of action brought by, or on  
    behalf of, any of its employees or agents.  For this purpose, each  
    Party, by mutual negotiation, hereby waives, with respect to the other  
    Party only, any immunity that would otherwise be available against  
    such claims under the industrial insurance provisions of Title 51 RCW.  
    In the event of any claims, demands, actions and lawsuits, the  
    indemnifying Party upon prompt notice from the other Party shall  
    assume all costs of defense thereof, including legal fees incurred by  
    the other Party, and of all resulting judgments that may be obtained  
    against the other Party.   In the event that any Party incurs attorney  
    fees, costs or other legal expenses to enforce the provisions of this  
    section, all such fees, costs and expenses shall be recoverable by the  
    prevailing Party. This indemnification shall survive the expiration or  
    earlier termination of this Agreement.  
  
    11.2. Venue  
  
    In the event that any Party deems it necessary to institute legal  
    action or proceedings to enforce any right or obligation under this  
    Fifth Supplement, the Parties hereto agree that any such action or  
    proceedings shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction  
    situated in Seattle, King County, Washington.  
  
    11.3. Effective Date.  
  
    This Fifth Supplement shall be effective as of September 1, 2003.  
  
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties hereto has executed this Fifth  
    Supplement by having its authorized representative affix his/her name  
    in the appropriate space below:

    Sound Transit and the City of Seattle for the Central Link Light Rail  
    Project  
  
    September 2003  
  
    1.0 Introduction  
  
    This scope of work describes City tasks and deliverables necessary to  
    facilitate Sound Transit's final design and implementation of Link  
    Initial Segment. Under this Supplement, the City agrees to provide  
    project management, expedited design review, recruitment and training  
    of police officers, expedited permit processing, and right-of-way  
    transfer management.  The scope of services defined in this Supplement  
    will commence September 1, 2003 and conclude December 31, 2004.  
    Modifications to this Scope of Work may be made by mutual agreement  
    between the Parties.  
  
    2.0 Scope of Work  
  
    2.1 Task 1 - Project Management  
  
    The City will continue to employ two tiers of project management.  The  
    Seattle Transportation's Core Team constitutes the first tier of  
    project management. It is comprised of the City's Program Manager,  
    Assistant Program Manager, Design Review and Permitting Manager,  
    Program Administrator, and consultants. SDOT's Core Team will:  
  
    * Provide management, oversight and coordination of Project-related  
    City activities to help ensure services are provided in an efficient  
    and effective manner.

    * Oversee his/her department's activities as defined in this Fifth  
    Supplement and the companion Construction Services Agreement.  
  
    * Ensure that the City has done whatever it reasonably can to help  
    Sound Transit become permit-ready.  
  
    * Serve as their department's liaison to Sound Transit.  
  
    * Manage resolution of design, permitting, construction and real  
    estate issues.  
  
    * Coordinate notification of private utilities about relocation.

    * SCL's project manager will also coordinate services among SCL's  
    three service centers, power stations, and systems planning office,  
    various City departments, and Sound Transit to efficiently and safely  
    design and construct necessary improvements in support of the Project.  
  
    * SFD's Project Manager will participate in development of national  
    standards related to fire protection and life safety of light rail  
    through the NFPA 130 Technical Committee on Fixed Guideway Transit  
    Systems.  
  
    * SPD's Project Manager will assist Sound Transit in planning and  
    preparing for Sound Transit's law enforcement needs as they relate to  
    Project construction and future operations.  
  
    * SPD's Project Manager will promote Crime Prevention through  
    Environmental Design (CPTED) by incorporating the considerations in

    2.2 Task 2 - Design Review  
  
    The City of Seattle will review Project design submittals in  
    accordance with the terms and conditions of this Fifth Supplement.  
    City design review activities supporting the final design effort  
    include pre-submittal reviews, identifying and resolving conflicting  
    City comments, and preparing and delivering one set of internally  
    consistent and coordinated City comments to Sound Transit for each  
    submittal.  
  
    The specific formal design submittals anticipated for the term of this  
    Agreement are listed below:  
  
    * C500 DSTT - 100% submittal  
    * C520 Pine Street Stub Tunnel - 60% submittal  
    * C520 Pine Street Stub Tunnel - 90% submittal  
    * C520 Pine Street Stub Tunnel - 100% submittal

    The City will provide a timely review of all submittals for compliance  
    with all applicable current City codes including but not limited to:  
    Uniform Building and Mechanical Codes, Land Use Code, ADA  
    requirements, site drainage, grading, environmentally critical areas,  
    energy codes, and Seattle Design Guidelines for Link Light Rail.  
  
    DCLU will incorporate the recommendations of the Seattle Light Rail  
    Review Panel (LRRP) in each formal submittal review.  DCLU will also  
    provide consolidated comments on behalf of three City commissions:  
    Design, Planning, and Arts.  
  
    2.3 Task 3 -Seattle Police Recruitment and Training  
  
    The SPD is required to recruit and train additional officers to  
    accommodate the traffic control, security and safety requirements  
    associated with Project construction.  Sound Transit's partial funding  
    of recruiting, training and equipping new officers is budgeted,  
    tracked and invoiced as Task 3.  
  
    2.4 Task 4 -Private Property Permitting by DCLU  
  
    Sound Transit and the City have recognized a need to provide tailored  
    permitting assistance to private property owners and businesses whose  
    property or business requires DCLU land use and/or building permits to  
    overcome impacts from Project implementation. DCLU staff will provide  
    this permitting assistance through continued participation in the Case  
    Management Group, as well as direct contact with impacted individuals  
    and businesses at the DCLU office.  
  
    The budget for Task 4 was established assuming six (6) properties  
    require permits for structural modifications, and fifty (50)  
    businesses require permits for relocations, including permits for  
    tenant improvements.  
  
    2.5 Task 5 - Sound Transit Permits by DCLU  
  
    DCLU will provide coordinated review of all Sound Transit land use  
    permit applications. DCLU will facilitate resolution of permit issues  
    with other City departments as needed.  DCLU will assist Sound Transit  
    with permit submittals to ensure applications are complete.  
  
    DCLU staff will work with Sound Transit to identify ways of expediting  
    the permit process for the Project.  Regarding the Master Use Permit  
    processes, at a minimum, DCLU will endeavor to meet the following  
    goals:  
  
    * Issue all MUP project numbers upon receipt of Address/Records  
    Worksheets.  
  
    * Accept Plot Plans with the best available Sound Transit survey  
    description when the Seattle Engineer's Maps lack sufficient  
    information.  
  
    * Ensure delivery of Pre-Application Site Visit Request Forms and Plot  
    Plans to the Site Development Desk in a timely manner.  
  
    * Issue a Site Inspection Report within 5 to 10 working days upon  
    receipt of the Pre-Application Site Visit Request Form and Plot Plan.  
  
    * Endeavor to schedule MUP Intake Appointments within 5 to 10 working  
    days of the request by Sound Transit contingent upon receipt of a  
    completed Site Inspection Report.  
  
    * Accept MUP applications at Intake although Plot Plan issues remain  
    unresolved.  
  
    * Work with Sound Transit staff and consultants, and legal advisors on  
    resolving Plot Plan issues during the MUP review process to avoid  
    delay in MUP issuance.  
  
    * Determine whether MUP applications are complete within two weeks of  
    Sound Transit submitting the MUP applications;  
  
    * Notify Sound Transit promptly of the need for changes or additional  
    information, and maintain regular communication with Sound Transit  
    staff, during the permit process.  
  
    * Issue a MUP decision within four months after the City required  
    public comment period has expired; and  
  
    * Provide Sound Transit draft MUP decisions and notices of  
    applications for review prior to publishing.  
  
    2.6 Task 6 - Right-of-Way Transfer Review and Coordination  
  
    SDOT will implement the City's responsibilities as established in the  
    intergovernmental Property Acquisition and Transfer Procedures  
    Agreement.  Task 6 includes the evaluation of Property Acquisition  
    Proposals and Transfer Proposals, as well as proactive measures to  
    develop SDOT's expectations for the form of right-of-way interest  
    acquired and transferred, and the environmental condition of the  
    property at time of transfer.  
  
    Sound Transit is responsible for all due diligence and acquisition  
    activities as established in the Property Acquisition and Transfer  
    Procedures Agreement.  Therefore, Task 6 excludes such activities  
    including title research, efforts to resolve special exceptions,  
    environmental investigations and remediation, development of legal  
    descriptions, and preparation of real estate documents.  
  
    3.0 Assumptions  
  
    3.1 Basis of Scope and Budget Estimate  
  
    The City has developed the proposed scope and budget based on current  
    knowledge of the schedule, Sound Transit's design and permitting  
    progress to date, and the scope of work associated with the  
    Construction Services Agreement and the Utility Undergrounding  
    Agreement.  
  
    3.2 Assumptions.  
  
    In addition to those assumptions stated elsewhere in this Fifth  
    Supplement, the following assumptions have been used in estimating the  
    effort required to provide the Scope  of Work.  
  
    * These estimates are for work to be performed in direct support of  
    the Project.  
  
    * These estimates are for work within the City's jurisdiction  
    (including work on property and facilities owned by the City outside  
    of Seattle).  
  
    * Estimates are based on the parties adhering to the definitions of

    4.0 Budget and Contingency  
  
    The Fifth Supplement to the MoA increases the MoA budget by $1,346,624  
    which, as evidenced in Exhibit 3, includes a 10% contingency of  
    $122,420.  The resulting revised total MoA budget amount equals  
    $15,099,309.  Of the total, $192,500 ($175,000 plus $17,500 in  
    contingency) is attributable to the work necessary to accommodate  
    right-of-way widening as established in Task 4 - Private Property  
    Permitting and Task 6 - Right-of-Way Transfer Review and Coordination.
