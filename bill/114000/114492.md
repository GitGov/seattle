      WHEREAS, the WSCTC filed a petition (C.F. 301557) for the vacation  
    of the above-referenced streets and alleys pursuant to Chapter 35.79  
    of the Revised Code of Washington and Seattle Municipal Code Chapter  
    15.62; and  
  
      WHEREAS, the Transportation Committee of the Seattle City Council  
    held a public hearing on the street vacation petition on February 17,  
    1999, as fixed by Resolution 29894; and  
  
      WHEREAS, the Transportation Committee of the Seattle City Council  
    discussed the project in several public meetings held in March and  
    April of 1999; and  
  
      WHEREAS, on April 5, 1999, the Seattle City Council Transportation  
    Committee recommended approval of the street vacation petition,  
    subject to conditions; and  
  
      WHEREAS, on April 12, 1999, the Seattle City Council granted  
    approval of the street vacation petition, subject to conditions; and  
  
      WHEREAS, execution of a Property Use and Development Agreement is  
    desired to ensure compliance with any conditions of street vacation  
    approval that will not be fully satisfied prior to passage of the  
    ordinance vacating the above-referenced streets and alleys;  
  
      NOW, THEREFORE, the WSCTC hereby covenants, bargains and agrees on  
    behalf of itself, its successors and assigns, that if the ordinance  
    vacating the above-referenced streets and alleys is passed by the  
    Seattle City Council and approved by the Mayor, the WSCTC shall  
    operate and maintain the Expansion Project in accordance with this  
    Property Use and Development Agreement:  
  
      Section 1.  Addressed below are those conditions of the street  
    vacation approval that require on-going effort during the operation of  
    the expanded Convention Center, and could not, therefore, be met  
    during the construction of the Expansion Project.  
  
      A.  Vacation for Public Purposes Only:  The structures built in the  
    vacated areas will be used for activities related to the expansion of  
    the Convention Center, or other public purposes only.  The expansion  
    is being financed by Certificates of Participation ("COP") which give  
    the trustee the right to take possession of the building and  
    structures under certain circumstances.  If for any reason the trustee  
    does take possession of the property, any subsequent use of the  
    structures located in the vacated property will be limited to public  
    Convention Center uses or other public purposes only.  If that public  
    use ever ceases, the vacated air-rights property over Pike Street and  
    8th Avenue will be rededicated to the public for street purposes.  
  
      B.  Truck Bridge Limitations:  Unless the truck bridge is in the  
    possession of the COP trustee, use of the bridge shall be limited to  
    Convention Center purposes only.  Not more than one vehicle will be  
    allowed to use the bridge at any one time.  The speed limit on the  
    bridge shall be limited to 10 mph.  Parking or prolonged idling or  
    standing of trucks on the bridge shall be prohibited.  
  
      C.  Glass Canopy Maintenance: In accordance with the plan submitted  
    to the Department of Design, Construction and Land Use of the City  
    ("DCLU"), the canopy shall be regularly cleaned inside and outside to  
    avoid any accumulation of dirt or grime.  Measures will be taken to  
    prevent roosting by birds in areas under the canopy.  
  
      D.  8th Avenue Cover:  In full satisfaction of  Part 2 of Vacation  
    Condition V.4. and in accordance with the plan submitted to DCLU, the  
    WSCTC has permanently installed six banner elements on pedestal bases,  
    in the sidewalk along 8th Avenue.  The WSCTC shall continue to provide  
    and maintain these elements.  
  
    E.  Visual Mitigation: In the display windows on the north side of  
    Pike Street at 8th Avenue, the WSCTC shall require a display with  
    visual interest that will attract pedestrians.  
  
      F.  Community Liaison:  WSCTC shall provide a community liaison  
    position during operation of the Convention Center facility.  The  
    liaison shall work with the neighboring businesses and residents to  
    resolve traffic, parking, noise and other environmental and operation  
    issues.  The liaison shall be available to answer questions and keep  
    the WSCTC informed as to community issues.  The telephone number of  
    the liaison shall be posted at the Convention Center and shall be  
    advertised in newspapers serving the adjacent communities at least  
    quarterly.  
  
      G.  Carpool Space Replacement:  WSCTC shall continue to provide the  
    14 carpool spaces on Pike Street that were displaced because of the  
    project within the Convention Center's main parking garage.  
  
    H.  As Built Drawings Required:  The WSCTC shall provide "as built"  
    drawings to DCLU and the Seattle Department of Transportation ("SDOT")  
    for the purpose of defining a three-dimensional space of air-rights  
    for the vacated area over Pike Street, 8th Avenue, and the alley in  
    Block 30.  The vacation ordinance may be amended to reference such  
    drawings and limit the air-rights to be vacated to the minimum  
    necessary to accommodate the built structures.  
  
      Section 2.  The legal description of the property upon which the  
    expanded Convention Center is located (the "Property") is included in  
    Exhibit 1 hereto, which is incorporated herein by this reference.  An  
    executed copy of this Property Use and Development Agreement shall be  
    recorded in the records of King County and the covenants hereof shall  
    be deemed to attach to and run with the Property.  
  
      Section 3.  This Property Use and Development Agreement may be  
    amended or modified by mutual agreement between the City and WSCTC,  
    according to the following procedure.  Minor changes to this Agreement  
    may be approved by SDOT, if the proposed change is consistent with the  
    purpose and intent of the conditions.  Any major changes to this  
    Agreement, as determined by SDOT, shall require approval by the City  
    Council of the City by resolution or ordinance.  SDOT shall provide  
    the WSCTC with notice and the opportunity to comment on whether a  
    change is considered minor or major, prior to SDOT making that  
    determination.  Nothing in this Property Use and Development Agreement  
    shall be construed as a surrender of the City's governmental powers.  
  
      Section 4.  This Property Use and Development Agreement is made for  
    the benefit of the City and the public.  The City may institute and  
    prosecute any proceeding law or in equity to enforce this Property Use  
    and Development Agreement.  
  
      Section 5.  It is further expressly agreed that in the event any  
    covenant or condition or restriction in this instrument or any portion  
    thereof is invalid or void, such invalidity or voidness shall in no  
    way affect any other covenant, condition or restriction.  
  
      Section 6.  The WSCTC agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless  
    from any claims, losses, liabilities, liens, costs or expenses  
    resulting from or arising out of the public use of the vacated areas  
    caused by the negligence of the WSCTC.  Nothing in this Agreement  
    shall alter responsibility for claims, losses, liabilities, liens,  
    costs or expenses resulting from or arising out of the public use of  
    the non-vacated areas of the public right-of-way.
