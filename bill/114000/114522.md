    WHEREAS, twenty-eight (28) City employees remain employed in City

    WHEREAS, as authorized by Ordinance 120922, an Employee Transition  
    Agreement amending the Woodland Zoo Operations and Management  
    Agreement was signed on November 25, 2002.  This Employee Transition

    Zoo Operations and Management Agreement  
  
    Between the City of Seattle and the Woodland Park Zoo Society  
  
    Employee Transition Plan  
  
    December 19, 2002  
  
    Purpose  
  
     The purpose of the Employee Transition Plan is to outline the terms  
    and conditions for implementing the City's legislative intent to move  
    the Zoo from City management to non-profit management under the  
    Zoological Society consistent with section 18.4 of the Zoo Operations  
    and Management Agreement and subsequent Zoo Separation Incentive  
    legislation.  Section 18.4 of the agreement provides for the  
    development of the Employee Transition Plan (ETP).  The plan is  
    intended to outline the timeframe and terms for transitioning all  
    current City zoo employees to the Zoological Society and ensure that  
    the transition provides for fair and equitable wages and benefits and  
    the opportunity for union representation for those transitioning Zoo  
    employees currently represented, if they so chose.  
  
    Ordinance 120697 approved an agreement between the City and the  
    Woodland Park Zoological Society whereby the Society assumed  
    responsibility for operation and management of the zoo for a renewable  
    twenty-year period.  The agreement between the Society and the  
    Department of Parks and Recreation was signed on March 1, 2002.  
    Subsequently the City Council adopted, and the City and the unions  
    agreed on a voluntary Zoo Separation Incentive Program (Zoo-SIP) that  
    provided additional incentives for City zoo employees to either retire  
    or resign from the City. The Zoological Society agreed to immediately  
    hire those employees voluntarily taking advantage of the Zoo-SIP.  
  
    Since the Zoo Operations and Management Agreement was signed in March,  
    the Zoo Society has worked hard to implement the provisions of the  
    agreement related to employee transition: The Society has 1) developed  
    a new employee benefit package that parallels City benefits 2)  
    implemented a new employee health plan, 3) implemented a new pension  
    plan 3) Revised its personnel policies in consultation with Parks  
    Human Resources 4) met regularly with representatives of labor 5)  
    worked with the City to develop the Zoo-Separation Incentive Program  
    to provide incentives for transitioning City employees 6) conducted  
    dozens of briefings and information sessions and prepared Q&A sheets  
    and comparisons for employees on the above mentioned benefits, and 7)  
    provided opportunities for all City zoo employees to meet in one-on-  
    one sessions with retirement experts to discuss their individual  
    situations.  
  
    Zoo Separation Incentive Program Provisions  
  
    The Zoo-SIP for City employees transferring in 2002 included the  
    following provisions:  
  
    * A one-time incentive payment equal to eight weeks of pay based on  
    the employees then current salary to be paid for by the Zoological  
    Society  
  
    * Option to have City Vacation Balances credited to the Zoo Society  
  
    * Option to have City Sick Leave Balances credited to the Zoo Society  
  
    * Option to have employee and City retirement contributions credited  
    to another pension plan, or the Zoo Society's plan  
  
    * Transitioning City service years are credited by the Zoo Society's  
    HR system  
  
    * Required that employees leave City service by December 3, 2002  
  
    * 115 employees retired or resigned through this program  
  
    Provisions for Employees transitioning after December 4, 2002  
  
    This Employee Transition Plan contains policies and provisions for  
    those City zoo employees who transition to the Zoo Society between  
    December 4, 2002 and December 31st 2004.  These provisions include:  
  
    * Option to have City Vacation Balances Credited (Identical to Zoo-

    Health Plan Comparison  
  
    This past fall the City of Seattle revised its health care benefit  
    based on the bids received from health care providers.  Those bids  
    reflected the unsettled state of healthcare nationwide and included a  
    significant increase in cost. The ultimate City health care benefit  
    plan, developed in consultation with Labor, resulted in an increase in  
    premium sharing and co-pays by employees. Simultaneously the  
    Zoological Society, using the same broker as the City, was upgrading  
    its coverage to more closely reflect the choices offered by the City.  
    The Society obviously faced the same cost pressures experienced by the  
    City.  In addition the Society was trying to respond to the expressed  
    desire of City employees to add Group Health coverage in addition to  
    Regence, the Society's current provider. Adding this option added cost  
    to the Society's coverage, as did offering spousal and dependent  
    coverage for the first time.   The resulting plan offered by the Zoo  
    Society is comparable to the health benefits offered by the City, and  
    includes an employee cost structure and premium share that is similar  
    to the City's for 2003.  
  
    RECOMMENDATION: The Zoo Society is still working to obtain "under 65"  
    retiree health care coverage.  They have made a formal request to the  
    City that the City offer the City plan to transitioned Zoo Employees.  
    Parks is asking the City Personnel Director to make a recommendation  
    about whether this option is 1) feasible and 2) advisable.   A  
    disposition of this question will be included in proposed legislation  
    if the City decides to offer such benefit.  
  
    Pension Plan  
  
    The section 18.5.3 of zoo operations and management agreement  
    contemplated an opportunity for City zoo employees to transfer to the  
    Zoo Society's retirement plan both their pension plan contributions  
    and the City's contributions in a manner that was neutral for both the  
    employees and the City Retirement System.  Subsequent work by the  
    Retirement System actuary and legal counsel determined that allowing  
    employees to transfer their contribution and the City's contribution  
    would not actuarially harm the system.  These findings provided the  
    basis for including the opportunity for transitioning employees to  
    roll over both their and the City's pension contributions as part of  
    the Zoo Separation Incentive Program adopted by the City Council on  
    September 16th 2002.  
  
    Under the Zoo-SIP employees had a choice to elect to A) retire ( if  
    eligible ) B) Retire and go to work for the Zoo Society C) Vest in the  
    City Retirement System, resign and go to work for the Zoo Society, D)  
    Resign and transfer both their contribution and the City's  
    contribution to another retirement vehicle( including the Society's)  
    and go to work for the Society. E) Resign and take both contributions  
    as lump sum payment.  
  
    Zoo Society Retirement Plan  
  
    The Zoo Society spent several months reviewing pension options,  
    including exploring the possibility of creating a defined benefit  
    plan.  They held discussions with several labor unions and plan  
    administrators and worked with actuaries but it proved impossible to  
    develop a cost effective plan that provided a defined benefit  
    comparable to the City's pension plan.  Efforts then turned to  
    alternative 403b defined contribution plans and an evaluation of the  
    best plans available. After a long RFP process that included both Zoo  
    Society and City zoo staff, Lincoln was selected to be the plan  
    provider based on services available and low fees to employees.  A  
    comparison of the Zoo Society and City retirement plans follows:

    9.1%-60% of highest 24 months of salary (excluding  premium pay)  
    depending on retirement credits (service years).  The actual total  
    amount received depends on the length of life of the retiree (and  
    possibly their beneficiaries). Sliding scale for retirement ages.  
  
    Vested balance of the individual's account .  Individuals decide what  
    they want to do with their lump sum distribution, i.e. transfer it to  
    an IRA account (where they continue earning investment returns) or  
    purchase an annuity, or any combination of such alternatives. There is  
    no Plan-specified retirement age or length of service.

    Varies depending on investment choices.  Employees have control to  
    elect from multiple options to meet their individual needs.  A "fixed"  
    option with rates similar to CD's is available.  
  
    Early Withdrawals (relating to termination of employment)  
  
    Currently, only the employee's deferrals plus the fixed earnings on  
    their deferrals can be removed from the plan prior to retirement.  
    (We're requesting authorization for an option of full account roll-  
    over into a Society Plan.)  
  
    Vested balance of the account is owned by the individual and can be  
    withdrawn/transferred to another tax-deferred retirement plan.  
  
    HR Policy Comparison  
  
     Over several months the Zoological Society staff and HR Consultants  
    met with the Department of Parks and Recreation HR staff and developed  
    a line-by-line comparison of the Zoological Society's and the City's  
    personnel and HR policies.  That policy comparison and the Zoo Society  
    Personnel Handbook have been provided to all employees.  
  
    Date Certain for Final Employee Transition  
  
    Employees who so elected already took advantage of the Zoo Separation  
    Incentive Program and become Zoo Society employees as of December 4,  
    2002.  
  
    Between December 4th 2002 and December 31st 2004, any City zoo  
    employee who voluntarily elects to transition to Zoo Society  
    employment may do so.  Employees transitioning after December 4th 2002  
    and before December 31st 2004 will be allowed to transfer their sick  
    leave and vacation balances as of their transition date but not later  
    than December 4, 2002.  Similarly, employees will be able to take both  
    the employee and employer share of their City retirement contributions  
    and be credited with their service years as of the transition date but  
    not later than December 4, 2002.  
  
    Project Hire  
  
    The City will make every effort to place those employees who do not  
    wish to become Zoo Society employees in other Parks or other City  
    positions for which they are qualified, including the "Project Hire"  
    program assistance.  The City agrees that employees will be  
    immediately eligible for Project Hire if they are in City positions  
    that will sunset on the effective date for final employee transition.  
  
    RECOMMENDATION:  All City employees working at the zoo become Zoo  
    Society employees as of December 31st 2004, or are transferred to City  
    positions in the Department of Parks and Recreation.  All City Zoo  
    positions are to be abrogated on December 31, 2004.  City will extend  
    Project Hire status to City employees at the Zoo immediately and make  
    every effort to find those who seek City jobs to find City jobs for  
    which they are qualified.  
  
    City Sun-setting of Vacant Zoo Positions  
  
    With the Adoption of the 2003 Budget, the Council approved legislation  
    to abrogate any City position at the Zoo still listed in the Park  
    Department Budget sunset upon becoming vacant.  This includes any  
    positions that are currently vacant.   This provision takes effect as  
    of 12/31/02. All positions filled at the zoo since the date of the Zoo  
    Operations and Management Agreement, March 1, 2002, have been filled  
    as Zoo Society positions.  
  
    Supervision of Any Employees Who Continue With City until Date Certain  
  
    For all zoo employees the Zoo Director will be the appointing  
    authority until December 31st 2004. The Zoo Director will work with  
    Labor Relations on 3rd Step Grievances.  All HR Responsibilities will  
    be delegated to the Zoo Society for remaining employees with the Zoo  
    Society HR coordinating directly with City HR.  Parks - Human  
    Resources Unit will provide payroll, and support as requested.  The  
    legislation implementing this agreement will include a MOU with the  
    affected bargaining unit representatives that conforms to the  
    Operations and Management Agreement by formally assigning the 'hiring  
    authority' role to the Zoo Director under current labor contracts.  
  
    New Collective Bargaining Agreement-Zoo Society Employees  
  
    The Zoological Society's intent is to bargain in good faith with any  
    union representing zoo employees who transition to Zoo Society to the  
    degree allowed under law and the rules of the National Labor Relations  
    Board.  This intent is codified in the legislation that authorized the  
    Zoo Operations and Management Agreement. It has been the Society's  
    position since the beginning of discussion with labor representatives  
    about non-profit management and was reiterated in the August 28, 2002  
    letter from Bill Lewis, Chair of the Zoo Society's Ad Hoc Transition  
    Task Force to the labor representatives.  
  
     The August 28 letter states; "If a substantial number of City  
    bargaining unit members take advantage of the SIP and a subsequent  
    offer of Zoo Society employment, the Zoo Society would expedite  
    recognition of the unions for purposes of bargaining and begin  
    bargaining a Zoo Society Collective Bargaining Agreement to the extent  
    allowable by law and the NLRA."  
  
    In the interim period as a new collective bargaining agreement is  
    being negotiated the Zoo Society will follow, where possible, the  
    spirit of the current CBA for currently represented employees who  
    transfer to the Zoo Society until December 31st 2004 or a new CBA is  
    negotiated with the Zoo Society.
