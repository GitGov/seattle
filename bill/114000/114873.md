    AN ORDINANCE approving the horizontal and vertical alignment and  
    locations of the monorail guideway, monorail transit stations, and  
    monorail operations center for the Seattle Popular Monorail  
    Authority's Green Line monorail transit system in the City of Seattle.  
  
    WHEREAS, the Seattle Popular Monorail Authority ("Seattle Monorail  
    Project") is a city transportation authority created pursuant to  
    chapter 35.95A RCW; and  
  
    WHEREAS, in 2002, pursuant to state law, voters in Seattle approved  
    Citizens' Petition No. 1, which created the Seattle Monorail Project,  
    approved the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan earlier adopted by the  
    Elevated Transportation Company, and provided for financing for phase  
    one of the Seattle Popular Monorail Plan, which phase includes an  
    approximately 14-mile-long monorail transit line known as the Seattle  
    Monorail Project Green Line ("Green Line"); and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Seattle Monorail Project, in cooperation with the United  
    States Coast Guard, has jointly issued a draft and final Environmental  
    Impact Statement ("EIS") pursuant to the National Environmental Policy  
    Act and the State Environmental Policy Act for the Green Line  
    proposal; and  
  
    WHEREAS, on March 29, 2004, the Seattle Monorail Project Board  
    selected the location of and authorized the implementation of the  
    Green Line monorail guideway alignment, stations and operations  
    center; and  
  
    WHEREAS, in September 2003, the City Council passed Ordinance 121278,  
    which established a permitting and approval system for monorail  
    transit facilities, and which stated that such permits and approvals  
    may be issued "only if the horizontal and vertical alignment and  
    locations of the monorail guideway, monorail transit stations, and  
    monorail operations center have been approved by the City Council by  
    ordinance or resolution" (codified at Seattle Municipal Code (SMC)  
    23.80.004.D.2; similar language in SMC 15.54.020.B); and  
  
    WHEREAS, in September 2003, the City Council adopted Resolution 30629,  
    in which it stated its intent to consider several factors when  
    reviewing the monorail alignment, including but not limited to  
    consistency with design guidelines, acceptability of construction  
    sequencing, and evidence that the Green Line can be built within  
    budget; and  
  
    WHEREAS, because there is not yet enough information to consider fully  
    the factors set forth in Resolution 30629, the Council intends to  
    approve the alignment now with the conditions stated in Sections 3  
    through 12 below, and may grant future Council approvals or  
    authorizations on further consideration of those factors; NOW,  
    THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1.  For purposes of Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 15.54.020.B  
    and SMC 23.80.004.D.2, and subject to Sections 3 through 14 below, the  
    horizontal and vertical alignment and locations of the monorail  
    guideway, monorail transit stations, and monorail operations center  
    for the Green Line monorail transit system are approved as described  
    in Exhibit A if they comply with the following:  
  
      A.  Above-ground structures of monorail guideways and monorail  
    transit stations (as defined in SMC 23.84.025) are approved only if:  
  
        (1)  located (a) within the horizontal envelope defined by the  
    dashed lines labeled "limits of alignment approval" in the plan view  
    drawings in Exhibit B1 and (b) below the dashed lines labeled "limits  
    of alignment approval" in the profile drawings in Exhibit B1; and  
  
        (2)  their location does not cause the dynamic envelope of a  
    monorail transit train to extend beyond the dashed lines labeled  
    "limits of alignment approval" in the plan view drawings in Exhibit  
    B1.  
  
        Below-grade structures and straddle bent structures may extend  
    outside the horizontal envelope defined by the "limits of alignment  
    approval" in the plan view drawings in Exhibit B1 only if the Director  
    of Transportation or the Director of Planning and Development  
    determines that they are necessary to support the monorail guideways  
    or other monorail transit facilities and approves their locations in  
    permits issued by the Seattle Department of Transportation or the  
    Department of Planning and Development.  
  
      B.  Notwithstanding the preceding subsection A., monorail transit  
    stations (as defined in SMC 23.84.025) and a monorail operations  
    center are approved only if located:  
  
        (1)  within  the horizontal envelope defined by the dashed lines  
    labeled "limits of alignment approval" in the plan view drawings in  
    Exhibit B1 or within the areas labeled "property identified for  
    station" or "property identified for operation center," respectively,  
    in Exhibit B2; and  
  
        (2)  below the dashed lines labeled "limits of alignment approval"  
    in the profile drawings in Exhibit B1.  
  
      C.  In the event of a conflict between the description in Exhibit A  
    and the drawings in Exhibit B, Exhibit B shall control.  
  
    Other notes and indicators on Exhibits B1 and B2, other than the  
    "limits of alignment approval," "property identified for station," and  
    "property identified for operation center," are not part of the  
    approval described above.  Neither Exhibit B1 nor Exhibit B2 specifies  
    the final, engineered location of the Green Line.  
  
    Section 2.  The approval described in Section 1 does not constitute  
    the City's consent for use of its property, including rights-of-way,  
    for the purposes of RCW 35.95A.050(1).  
  
    Section 3.  Development of the Green Line monorail transit system that  
    is the subject of the approval described in Section 1 shall be  
    consistent with a transit way agreement that is anticipated to be  
    authorized by the City Council and then executed by the City and the  
    Seattle Monorail Project.  
  
    Section 4.  On Second Avenue and on Second Avenue Extension South, the  
    minimum clearance between the monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and  
    the abutting property line shall be 14 feet, with one foot variance  
    allowed either way (13 to 15 feet) for design flexibility, provided  
    that this minimum clearance shall not apply where the Monorail  
    Guideway curves east as it approaches Stewart Street and curves west  
    as it approaches 3rd Avenue South.  The priorities for design and  
    allocation of the public right-of-way on Second Avenue and on Second  
    Avenue Extension South shall be, in the following order:  
  
    Priority Level I  
  
      1.  Pedestrians and sidewalks - existing sidewalk widths shall be  
    required to be maintained or increased on each side of the street;  
  
      2.  Bus lanes;  
  
      3.  Dedicated Bicycle Lane on Second Avenue and on Second Avenue  
    Extension South - shall be maintained, or re-established southbound on  
    an alternative avenue through downtown, provided that if the bicycle  
    lane is moved, the lane must be re-established prior to closure of the  
    Second Avenue lane;  
  
      4.  Balance Guideways concentrically over Columns and Minimize  
    Guideway Column widths wherever technically feasible - this may be  
    achieved through use of design and engineering with high strength  
    steel and concrete and/or increasing the number of columns to reduce  
    loads per column.  
  
    Priority Level II  
  
      1.  General Purpose Traffic Lanes; and  
  
      2.  On-street parking.  
  
    Section 5.  On Harrison Street, the minimum clearance between the  
    monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line shall  
    be ten feet, provided that this minimum clearance shall not apply  
    where the monorail guideway curves north near the west end of Harrison  
    Street as it approaches Elliott Avenue, nor where the monorail  
    guideway curves north near the east end of Harrison Street as it  
    approaches 1st Avenue N.  Either a south-side-of-street alignment or a  
    center-of-street alignment or a combination of these two is approved,  
    within the bounds shown in Exhibit B.  The Seattle Monorail Project  
    shall analyze these alignments and their impacts and shall work with  
    SDOT and the community, and then SMP shall decide the final alignment.  
  
    Section 6.  On California Avenue SW, the minimum clearance between the  
    monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line shall  
    be ten feet, provided that this minimum clearance shall not apply  
    where the monorail guideway curves east as it approaches SW Edmunds  
    Street.  
  
    Section 7.  On 15th Avenue NW, the minimum clearance between the  
    monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line shall  
    be six feet, provided that this minimum clearance shall not apply  
    where the monorail guideway curves west as it approaches the crossing  
    of the Lake Washington Ship Canal.  
  
    Section 8.  On 35th Avenue SW, the minimum clearance between the  
    monorail vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line shall  
    be 20 feet, provided that this minimum clearance shall not apply where  
    the monorail guideway curves west as it approaches SW Alaska Street,  
    nor where the monorail guideway curves east as it approaches SW Avalon  
    Way.  
  
    Section 9.  SMP shall work with the DBOM contractor to achieve greater  
    than 6 feet between the dynamic envelope and property lines where  
    prudent and technically feasible to do, consistent with the Council  
    and SMP Board's direction to date in regard to balancing competing  
    needs.  
  
    Section 10.  During design of the Green Line segment near King Street  
    Station, the Seattle Monorail Project must work with the Washington  
    State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), Burlington Northern Santa  
    Fe (BNSF), Amtrak, Sound Transit, King County, and other relevant  
    parties, to:  (1) provide reasonable accommodation for possible future  
    railroad track and platform expansion to accommodate growth in  
    passenger rail, including Amtrak and Sounder service; (2) minimize  
    negative impacts to King Street Station related to ingress and egress,  
    taxis, parking, and buses; and (3) minimize negative impacts to the  
    historic integrity and character of the structure.  
  
    Section 11.  An elevated station connection from a station on the west  
    side of 5th Avenue between Virginia Street and Stewart Street to  
    Westlake Center or any other location south of Stewart Street is  
    approved only if the City Council first grants a skybridge permit for  
    that elevated connection pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code chapter  
    15.64, Skybridge Permits.  
  
    Section 12.  For the Elliott & Mercer station, the Seattle Monorail  
    Project shall analyze both a vertical station and a side-by-side  
    station, and shall work with the community, and then SMP shall decide  
    the final station configuration.  
  
    Section 13.  When the Seattle Department of Transportation and the  
    Department of Planning and Development review applications for  
    monorail transit facilities pursuant to SMC 15.54.020 and SMC  
    23.80.004 for consistency with monorail transit system design  
    guidelines, they shall pay special attention to locations and design  
    of switches and straddle bent structures and the extent to which they  
    are consistent with the design guidelines in sections I.A. and I.C. of  
    Exhibit A to Ordinance 121446.  
  
    Section 14.  Notwithstanding Section 1, for each monorail segment for  
    which this ordinance states a minimum clearance between the monorail  
    vehicle dynamic envelope and the abutting property line, no monorail  
    transit facilities may be located in the minimum clearance area unless  
    they are also (a) reviewed through City design review and permitting  
    processes and approved by the Director of Transportation or the  
    Director of Planning and Development, or (b) deemed necessary for  
    safety reasons by the Director of Transportation or the Director of  
    Planning and Development.  
  
    Section 15.  This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty  
    (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not  
  
    approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after  
    presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code  
    Section 1.04.020.
