    AN ORDINANCE relating to Seattle Public Utilities; prohibiting certain  
    recyclable materials from disposal in commercial, residential and  
    self-haul garbage; establishing enforcement provisions; and amending  
    the Seattle Municipal Code by creating two new sections in Chapter  
    21.36.and by amending section 21.36.922.  
  
    WHEREAS, the City of Seattle adopted a recycling goal of 60% in 1989;  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City has been continually introducing innovative and  
    convenient programs for residents to recycle on a voluntary basis and  
    sponsoring educational outreach programs to businesses; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City achieved a level of 44% recycling of the total City  
    waste stream in 1995; and  
  
    WHEREAS, since 1995, however, the City's recycling rate has  
    continuously declined to a 38% level in 2001 with the greatest decline  
    coming from commercial sector recycling; and  
  
    WHEREAS, businesses and residents continue to discard in the garbage  
    significant quantities of recyclable paper, cardboard, glass and  
    plastic bottles, aluminum and tin cans and yard waste for which  
    markets are established and opportunities to recycle readily available  
    either through City sponsored curbside and transfer station programs  
    or private recycling services; and  
  
    WHEREAS, to reverse this downward trend in recycling rates, the City  
    has decided to prohibit the disposal of certain recyclable materials  
    in the garbage by businesses and residents effective January 1, 2005  
    with penalties to be imposed for non-compliance starting January 1,
