    future officials, employees, and agents, harmless from and against  
    any and all claims, demands, penalties, fees, damages, losses,

    release of any Hazardous Substance in, on, under or emanating from  
    the Property, or any portion thereof or improvement thereon, from any  
    cause whatsoever; it being intended that Grantee shall so indemnify  
    Grantor and such personnel without regard to any fault or  
    responsibility of Grantor or Grantee.   The obligation to complete  
    all environmental investigation, removal or remediation of the  
    Property and the acknowledgement, release and indemnification touch  
    and concern the Property, restrict the use of the Property,  
    constitute an assessment against the Property and are intended to run  
    with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and  
    assigns, and inure to the benefit of Grantor and its successors and  
    assigns.

    mean petroleum products and compounds containing them; flammable  
    materials; radioactive materials; polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs")

    contamination or cleanup.  
  
    Grantee's release shall include both claims by Grantee against  
    Grantor and cross-claims against Grantor by Grantee based upon claims  
    made against Grantee by any and all third parties. The obligation to  
    indemnify and defend shall include, but not be limited to, any  
    liability of Grantor to any and all federal, state or local  
    regulatory agencies or other persons or entities for remedial action  
    costs and natural resources damages claims.  The obligation to  
    complete all environmental investigation, removal or remediation of  
    the Property and the acknowledgement, release and indemnification  
    touch and concern the Property, restrict the use of the Property,  
    constitute an assessment against the Property and are intended to run  
    with the land and bind Grantee and Grantee's heirs, successors and  
    assigns, and inure to the benefit of Grantor and its successors and  
    assigns.    This release means that Grantee accepts the Property "as-  
    is, where-is and with-all-faults," and that Grantee assumes all  
    responsibility of Grantor to investigate, remove and remediate any  
    environmental conditions on the Property and has no recourse against  
    Grantor or any of its officers, employees or agents for any claim or  
    liability with respect to the Property.  
  
    Grantor shall have the right to defend itself and seek from Grantee  
    recovery of any damages, liabilities, settlement awards and defense  
    costs and expenses incurred by Grantor if Grantee does not accept  
    unconditionally Grantor's tender to Grantee of the duty to  
    investigation, remove and/or remediate environmental conditions on  
    the Property and/or defend and indemnify Grantor against any such  
    claim, suit, demand, penalty, fee, damages, losses, cost or expense.  
    This Covenant shall apply regardless of whether or not Grantee is  
    culpable, negligent or in violation of any law, ordinance, rule or  
    regulation.  This Covenant is not intended, nor shall it, release,  
    discharge or affect any rights or causes of action that Grantor or  
    Grantee may have against any other person or entity, except as  
    otherwise expressly stated herein, and each of the parties reserves  
    all such rights including, but not limited to, claims for  
    contribution or cost recovery relating to any Hazardous Substance in,  
    on, under or emanating from the Property.
