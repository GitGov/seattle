    THIS DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered into  
    by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE ("City"), a first class city of the  
    State of Washington, acting by and through its Department of Parks and

    not-for-profit corporation organized in 1905 under the laws of the  
    State of New York.  
  
    RECITALS  
  
    WHEREAS, the City owns and DPR has jurisdiction over and manages  
    Seward Park including the Seward Park Music Annex Building (the  
    "Building") and the Hatchery located within Seward Park; and  
  
    WHEREAS, on November 7, 2000, the voters of the City of Seattle  
    approved Ordinance 120024, the Parks and Green Spaces Levy, which  
    identified the sum of $618,600.00 to partially fund renovation of the  
    Building and the Hatchery for use as an Environmental Education Center  
    (the "Project"); and  
  
    WHEREAS, Ordinance 120024 expresses the City's intention to leverage  
    said funds through collaborations with public and private  
    organizations to enhance the projects and programs funded through the  
    levy lid lift; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Audubon is a private non-profit conservation organization,  
    whose mission is to conserve and restore natural ecosystems, focusing  
    on birds, other wildlife, and their habitats for the benefit of  
    humanity and the earth's biological diversity.  The organization is  
    named after naturalist and wildlife painter John James Audubon, a  
    renowned conservationist of Haitian and French parentage; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Audubon has established a state office in Washington, Audubon  
    Washington, to carry out its mission and oversee its activities in the  
    State of Washington; and  
  
    WHEREAS, DPR has established an Environmental Stewardship Commitment  
    Statement, which reads, in part, Seattle Parks and Recreation will be  
    a role model for environmentally friendly practices.  The Department  
    will provide opportunities and offer programs for citizens that foster  
    awareness, appreciation, and knowledge that inspire actions to protect  
    and enhance the natural environment.  All Department classes and  
    programs will promote environmental stewardship and volunteerism; and  
  
    WHEREAS, DPR and Audubon both work to educate the general public about  
    environmental issues and conservation and to develop educational  
    programs for children, youth, and families; and  
  
    WHEREAS, both parties share a commitment to serving diverse audiences  
    and a programmatic approach that uses first-hand experience in the  
    natural habitat; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Audubon and DPR concur that the renovation of the Building  
    and the Hatchery is an appropriate project for a public/private  
    partnership; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the parties agree that the public benefits from this  
    programmatic partnership are substantial, including financial  
    contributions from Audubon to renovate and improve the Building to  
    develop an important public environmental education and community  
    programming facility; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Audubon and DPR recognize that they cannot accomplish the  
    environmental and conservation educational goals alone and given the  
    many other demands for DPR's financial resources, DPR cannot complete  
    the Project without substantial private donations; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Audubon recognizes that a successful private fundraising  
    campaign needs a public commitment to the Project from governmental  
    agencies, including the City; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Audubon and DPR desire to collaborate to achieve their shared  
    long-term vision and goals with respect to the renovation of the

    complementary community-based environmental education programs and  
    conservation initiatives to a diverse audience; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Resolution 30339 authorized a Memorandum of Understanding  
    between DPR and Audubon for a partnership to provide environmental  
    education in Seward Park; for the renovation of the Seward Park Music  
    Annex Building for said purpose; and authorizing future work to  
    implement the terms of the parties' agreement; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Audubon and DPR wish to enter into this Agreement for the  
    purpose of setting forth the development parameters and funding  
    commitments and establishing the parameters for joint use of the  
    Building and the Hatchery.

    ARTICLE 2 PURPOSE; LONG TERM OCCUPANCY; INTERIM USE; CONSTRUCTION  
    TIMING; APPROVALS  
  
    2.1 Purpose.  The purpose of this Agreement is to memorialize the  
    parties' understandings and objectives with regard to the renovation  
    of the Building and the Hatchery and the use of each facility to  
    deliver public environmental programs.  Once the Building is  
    renovated, it is anticipated that it will house a DPR naturalist  
    assigned to Audubon pursuant to an employee loan agreement between the  
    City and Audubon, DPR's TREC program and Audubon's nature programs  
    based at Seward Park.  It is the parties' intent that use of the  
    Building and the Hatchery be consistent with DPR's education and  
    conservation objectives.  It is also the parties' intent that their  
    respective programs at Seward Park will complement the other entities'  
    programs and that they will coordinate the delivery of education and  
    conservation objectives to avoid duplication within Seward Park.  
  
    2.2 Long Term Occupancy by Audubon.  Contemporaneously with this  
    Agreement, the parties shall execute the Use and Occupancy Agreement,  
    Exhibit E, which will: (1) establish Audubon's right to use and occupy  
    the Premises; (2) establish Audubon's right to use the Hatchery  
    Program Areas and the Seward Park Common Areas; and (3) set parameters  
    for the coordinated delivery by the parties of public environmental  
    programs in Seward Park; all in accordance with the terms contained  
    herein and in the Use and Occupancy Agreement.  Upon issuance of the  
    Certificate of Occupancy for the Building, the parties shall modify  
    the Use and Occupancy Agreement to include the actual square footage  
    of the Premises and Building Common Areas; the dollar amount of the  
    annual rent, including offsets, as determined pursuant to the criteria  
    set forth in Article V of the Use and Occupancy Agreement; and the  
    date of the first Consumer Price Index adjustment, as those terms are  
    defined in the Use and Occupancy Agreement.  
  
    2.3 Interim Use of Building.  Prior to the completion of the Project,  
    Audubon may use the Building's conference and activity rooms, subject  
    to their availability.  Audubon may also use Seward Park's established  
    trails and shoreline for environmental programming purposes pursuant  
    to a DPR Use Permit and subject to their availability, with authorized  
    uses being in accordance with the then-current DPR fees and charges,  
    if applicable.  Audubon may also show the Building to prospective  
    funding sources for the Project and may enter the Building for  
    purposes of facilitating design and renovation of the Building;  
    provided that, Audubon's interim use of the Building shall be  
    coordinated with use of the Building by DPR's TREC and Naturalist  
    Program staff and other scheduled uses of the Building and shall not  
    disrupt activities occurring in the Building.  Notwithstanding the  
    foregoing,  the City agrees that TREC and the Naturalist Program staff  
    shall vacate the Building within ten (10) working days from the date  
    that Audubon provides notice of the commencement of construction work  
    pursuant to Article 6.8.1 of this Agreement and neither TREC nor the  
    Naturalist Programs staff, nor any other party, shall have the right  
    to enter the Building or the construction area until a Certificate of  
    Final Completion has been issued for the Building, except for  
    inspections as described in Article 6.4.  DPR shall be solely  
    responsible for removing all DPR and personal materials from the  
    Building prior to the commencement of construction.  
  
    2.4 Construction Timing.  The parties agree that the following  
    parameters shall govern the commencement and completion of  
    construction:  
  
    2.4.1  Audubon acknowledges that the Project Budget is based upon  
    construction commencing in 2004.  To that end, Audubon agrees that it  
    will diligently endeavor, but is not required, to cause construction  
    of the Building portion of the Project to commence by the end of 2004.  
    In the event that Audubon does not commence construction in 2004, and  
    as a result of such delay, the cost of construction increases based  
    upon the inflationary index or from deterioration of the Building's  
    condition, Audubon agrees to be solely responsible for such cost  
    increases unless such delay or cost increase is a direct result of any  
    action or inaction of the City that was not caused by some action or  
    inaction by Audubon.  
  
    The City similarly acknowledges that the Project Budget is based upon  
    construction commencing in 2004.  To that end, the City agrees that it  
    will diligently endeavor, but is not required, to cause construction  
    of the Hatchery portion of the Project to commence by the end of 2004;  
    provided that the City agrees that it will not commence construction  
    of the Hatchery until such time that Audubon commences construction of  
    the Building.  In the event that the City is unable to commence  
    construction in 2004 solely a result of Audubon's failure to commence  
    construction of the Building in 2004 Audubon shall be responsible for  
    any cost increase in the Project Budget for the Hatchery which is  
    attributable to inflation (as based upon the standard inflationary  
    index).  If the delay in the commencement of construction of the  
    Hatchery is a the result of causes other than Audubon's failure to  
    commence construction of the Building in 2004 or a direct result of  
    any action or inaction by Audubon, the City shall be solely  
    responsible for any attendant cost increases in the Project Budget for  
    the Hatchery  
  
    2.4.2  Unless extended by the City, Audubon shall commence  
    construction of the Building no later than December 31, 2006.  In the  
    event that Audubon has not commenced construction of the Building by  
    this date, through no action of the City and barring Force Majeure  
    events, the City may immediately terminate this Agreement pursuant to  
    Article 11 of this Agreement.  
  
    2.4.3  Once construction of each component of the Project has  
    commenced, the responsible party will proceed with diligence to cause  
    such component to be renovated in accordance with all approved Project  
    designs, specifications, and schedules, subject to delays for Force  
    Majeure.  Each party agrees that every reasonable effort will be made  
    to complete its respective component of the Project by December 31,  
    2007, consistent with the terms of the Ordinance 120024; provided,  
    that, as to Audubon, the following shall apply if construction of the  
    Building is not complete by such date:  
  
    (a)  The City shall use its best efforts to extend use of any  
    remaining portion of the City Share of Project Costs beyond the end of  
    2007 or, in the alternative, to identify another source of public  
    funds to replace the unspent levy proceeds.  
  
    (b)  In the event that the City is unable to extend the remaining  
    portion of the City Share of Project Costs or to identify another  
    source of public funds, Audubon shall be solely responsible for all  
    costs necessary to complete the Building.  
  
    ARTICLE 3  AUDUBON'S FINANCIAL COMMITMENT  
  
    3.1 Funding Thresholds.  Prior to Audubon's execution of any contracts  
    associated with the Project Budget (i.e. design or construction  
    related contracts), Audubon must submit to DPR documentation  
    (including actual receipts and pledges) of having raised the full  
    amount of Audubon's required funding for that particular portion of  
    the Project, i.e.,  
  
    a) Prior to execution of the design contract for the Building, Audubon  
    must submit to DPR documentation of having raised $236,353.  
  
    b) Prior to execution of the construction contract for the Building,  
    Audubon must submit to DPR documentation of having raised $1,136,517  
    plus any additional sum as mutually agreed upon by both parties.  
  
    c) Audubon agrees to place such funds in Audubon-controlled restricted  
    accounts; provided that, the interest earned on such accounts shall be  
    unrestricted and the interest earned may be used by Audubon for any  
    purpose, consistent with Audubon accounting practices and donor  
    restrictions.  
  
    3.2  Usable Building Commitment.  Subject to Article 7 below (City  
    Environmental Indemnity), following the commencement of construction,  
    Audubon agrees and warrants that, if Audubon abandons the Project  
    prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, Audubon shall  
    pay the amount required to make the Building usable, as reasonably  
    determined by the Superintendent, and habitable as required by code,  
    and shall reimburse the City for the City contributions to the Project  
    planning, design and construction; provided that, in no event shall  
    that amount exceed the unused portion of Audubon's $1,372,869 total  
    funding commitment plus any additional sum previously agreed upon by  
    both parties.  For purposes of this Article 3.20, the term "abandon"  
    shall mean Audubon's failure to direct its construction contractor to  
    finish the Building pursuant to the construction contract, unless due  
    to a delay caused by the City's wrongful action or failure to act, or  
    to cause, through failure to pay its construction contract, its  
    contractor to physically and permanently abandon the Building.  
  
    ARTICLE 4 PROJECT BUDGET; COST SHARING  
  
    4.1 Project Budget.  The Project Budget, as most recently revised, is  
    appended to this Agreement as Exhibit C-1 and incorporated herein by

    attachment, by this reference, is and shall be incorporated herein.  
  
    4.2 Project Cost Sharing.  The City and Audubon agree to share the

    follows:  for the renovation of the Building, Audubon shall pay  
    $1,372,869 and the City shall pay $305,577.  For the renovation of the  
    Hatchery, the City shall pay $313,023.  Of the City's $305,577 for the  
    Building, approximately $25,431 has already been spent or encumbered  
    by the City for planning and design work.  
  
    4.2.1 The parties shall ensure that the bids for the Building and  
    Hatchery portions of the Project are separately stated.  If bids for  
    either portion of the Project exceed the current estimate, the scope  
    of that component of the Project shall be reduced as provided in  
    Article 6.5, below.  
  
    4.2.2   If the Project costs are less than $1,991,469, City and  
    Audubon each shall pay a proportionate share of such Project Costs  
    (i.e., City's share shall be $618,600/$1,991,469 and Audubon's share  
    shall be $1,372,869/$1,991,469).  If actual construction costs for  
    either portion of the Project are less than budgeted, the savings  
    shall be used to offset cost overruns in the other portion of the  
    Project.  
  
    4.3 Fundraising Assistance.  It is anticipated that the Audubon Share  
    of Project Costs will come from private donations and, potentially,  
    public grant sources other than DPR.  DPR will assist Audubon in its  
    fundraising efforts by communicating DPR's support for the Project and  
    making appropriate representatives available to provide information  
    and answer questions at fundraising events whenever possible.  
  
    4.4 Present Fundraising Status.  As of the date of this Agreement,  
    Audubon has raised $200,000 of the $1,372,869 that it has committed  
    toward the Building portion of the Project.  Audubon agrees that, from  
    time to time, upon request by the City, it shall provide the City with  
    documentation of such funds; provided, however, that, Audubon shall  
    not be required to provide any identifying information relating to  
    private fundraising activities or private donor information.  
  
    ARTICLE 5 RENOVATION PROJECT; DESIGN  
  
    5.1 Management of Project Design.  Audubon shall contract for and  
    manage the design for the Building renovation, in consultation with  
    DPR and subject to its approval, which approval will not be  
    unreasonably withheld.   DPR shall contract for and manage the design  
    for the Hatchery renovation, in consultation with Audubon.  Design  
    approvals shall be obtained from the non-managing entity at completion  
    of the design program, early schematics, 100% schematics, 50% design  
    development, 100% design development, 50% construction drawings and  
    99% construction drawings; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by  
    the parties, the non-managing entity will complete its review and  
    provide to the other party notice of its approval or disapproval  
    thereof within seven (7) working days of receipt of such design.  Each  
    party shall ensure that the other, through the respective Project  
    Representatives, is provided the opportunity to be involved and serve  
    as a participant in on-going decision-making with respect to the  
    design and construction of the Project, which participation shall  
    include, without limitation, attending design team meetings, providing  
    comments on design, attending meetings with the construction  
    contractor(s), and providing comments on construction issues.  Audubon  
    shall pay for any additional DPR assistance it desires during the  
    design phase at current DPR project management rates.  
  
    5.2 Design Values.  City and Audubon agree that the Project design  
    shall comply with any requirements established by the City's  
    Landmark's Board, with any other adopted City and Park standards, and  
    the mutually agreed upon design programs for each component of the  
    Project.  To the extent feasible, the parties shall incorporate design  
    elements such as would allow a structure to achieve the certified  
    level of the United States Green Building Council Leadership in Energy  
    and Environmental Design rating system.  In addition, and to the  
    extent feasible within the project budget, the design of the Hatchery  
    portion of the project will incorporate methods for controlling  
    vehicle access between the Building and the Hatchery.  
  
    5.3 Public Involvement in Project Design.  Audubon shall conduct a  
    public meeting to develop consensus on the Building concept and scope  
    prior to schematic design.  It shall conduct a second public meeting  
    after schematic design, and a third public meeting prior to completion  
    of construction documents.   If Audubon so requests, DPR shall attend  
    and participate in such meetings, at Audubon's expense; otherwise, DPR  
    staff may voluntarily attend any such meetings at their own expense.  
  
    5.4 Public Work.  The design contract for the Building shall be by  
    Audubon pursuant to processes that: (a) satisfy all state and local  
    laws for the solicitation of proposals or bids by contractors who are  
    qualified to undertake design of the Building, and (b) fully comply  
    with all other applicable federal, state and local requirements  
    applicable to the Building, including those requirements related to  
    the inclusion of required terms and conditions applicable to the  
    Building in all such contracts.  Among other requirements, such  
    contracts will meet the following requirements for City public works  
    projects utilizing City funding: (i) fair contracting practices  
    (Chapter 14.10 SMC); and (ii) all applicable federal, state and local  
    nondiscrimination requirements.  
  
    5.5 Changes in Approved Building Design and Specifications.  If  
    Audubon proposes to change or amend the approved Building design or  
    any specification(s) that would cause the Building to exceed the  
    Project Budget for that portion of the Project or that would result in  
    a change contrary to the requirements established by the City's  
    Landmarks Board or any other adopted City or DPR standards or the  
    Building Design Program, such proposed change or amendment will be  
    subject to the written approval of the City.  The City will complete  
    its review of any such proposed changes or amendments and provide to  
    Audubon notice of its approval or disapproval thereof within ten (10)  
    working days of receipt of any such proposed change or amendment.  
  
    5.6 No Representations or Liability.  No City approval of any Building  
    design or specification(s) (or amendments thereto) shall constitute an  
    opinion or representation by the City as to their (i) compliance with  
    any law, ordinance or standard, or (ii) suitability for any purpose  
    other than those associated with the Building.  
  
    5.7 Americans with Disabilities Act.  Audubon shall comply, and  
    require its consultants and contractors to comply, with all applicable  
    provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act  ("ADA") in  
    performing its obligations under this Agreement.  Failure to comply  
    with the provisions of the ADA shall be considered a material breach  
    of this Agreement.  
  
    ARTICLE 6 RENOVATION PROJECT; CONSTRUCTION  
  
    6.1 Management of Project Construction.  Audubon shall contract for  
    and manage construction of the Building improvements in consultation  
    with DPR and DPR shall contract for and manage construction of the  
    Hatchery improvements in consultation with Audubon.  Audubon shall  
    obtain a warranty from their construction contractor and name the City  
    as a joint obligee.  
  
    6.2 Regulatory Approvals; Compliance.  Each party shall be responsible  
    for securing all necessary regulatory approvals related to the  
    development and construction of its portion of the Project and each  
    party shall be responsible for ensuring compliance during construction  
    with any and all conditions or other requirements associated with such  
    regulatory approvals.  The parties agree to work cooperatively with  
    one another, as necessary, to secure necessary regulatory approvals.  
  
    6.3 Public Work.  The construction of the Project shall be a public  
    work and Audubon shall comply with all laws with respect thereto.  The  
    construction contract for the Building shall be let by Audubon  
    pursuant to processes that: (a) satisfy all state and local laws for  
    the solicitation of proposals or bids by contractors who are qualified  
    to undertake development or construction of the Building, and (b)  
    fully comply with all other applicable federal, state and local  
    requirements applicable to the Building, including those requirements  
    related to the inclusion of required terms and conditions applicable  
    to the Building in all such contracts.  Among other requirements, such  
    contracts will meet the following requirements for City public works  
    projects utilizing City funding: (i) fair contracting practices  
    (Chapter 14.10 SMC); (ii) all applicable federal, state and local  
    nondiscrimination requirements; and (iii) the requirements set forth  
    in RCW 35.22.650.  
  
    6.4 Site Visits and Inspections.  Each party shall allow the other  
    party, through the respective Project Managers, to visit its  
    construction site to review and inspect the work; provided that, any  
    such inspection shall be a cost borne solely by the inspecting party  
    and shall not be deducted from the Construction Costs, unless the  
    costs are included within the Project Budget.  To the extent that  
    official inspections are required by applicable City codes and  
    regulations, Audubon may employ a qualified inspector for such  
    purpose; provided that, Audubon must obtain DPR's approval of such  
    inspector prior to the required inspections, which approval will not  
    be unreasonably withheld.  
  
    6.5 Options if Bids Exceed Total Construction Cost.  If the bid  
    received for either component of the Project from the lowest and best  
    bidder exceeds the estimated construction cost for that Project  
    component, the managing party may (i) reject all bids and re-bid that  
    component of the Project; (ii) consult with the appropriate architect  
    to identify design changes to the Building Design Program that would  
    enable that component of the Project to be constructed within the  
    budgeted amount; or (iii) voluntarily pay the increased amount and  
    proceed with construction.  In the event of a redesign, such design  
    changes shall be implemented and the managing party shall again invite  
    bids for the construction of that component of the Project or any  
    portion thereof; provided that, if design changes are elected to  
    reduce the cost of construction of a Project component, the non-  
    managing party may, at its option, pay the difference in cost to  
    retain the original or more costly design.  
  
    6.6 Cost Overruns.  If, during construction, it becomes apparent that  
    the actual construction costs for either component of the Project will  
    exceed the estimated construction costs shown in the current Project  
    Budget, including any contingency allowance, for that component of the  
    Project, the party responsible for managing that component of the  
    Project (the "managing party") shall be solely responsible for any  
    cost overruns for the component of the Project; provided that, the  
    parties may agree, if possible, that Project funds be reallocated so  
    that the total Project cost remains within the Project Budget;  
    provided further that, the managing party may seek a design  
    modification to bring that component of the Project within the  
    estimated construction costs, subject to the approval provisions  
    contained in Article 6.8.2.  If a design modification is made, the  
    managing party shall be solely responsible for paying all costs  
    associated therewith.  
  
    6.7 Additional Funding.  If either of the events described in Article  
    6.5 (bids exceed the Project Budget) or Article 6.6 (cost overrun)  
    occur, the City and Audubon, as an alterative or an additional remedy,  
    may agree upon a collaborative plan to seek additional funding.  Any  
    such agreement or plan shall be set forth as an amendment to this  
    Agreement and to the extent practicable, shall include provisions for  
    both public and private funding sources.  
  
    6.8 Construction Phase Approvals and Control of Work; Substantial  
    Completion and Final Completion.  
  
    6.8.1  Work Notification.  Audubon shall notify DPR, in writing, at  
    least ten (10) working days prior to the commencement of construction  
    work on the Building.  At that time or earlier, if possible, Audubon  
    shall provide information on the areas that will be needed for staging  
    of construction.  DPR shall approve such areas, or identify alternate  
    areas for staging if necessary to avoid disruption of community use of  
    the park; provided that, DPR shall ensure that any alternative  
    construction areas are convenient to the Building construction areas  
    and will not add undue costs to construction of the Building.  DPR  
    shall thereafter, in a timely manner, issue construction license  
    agreements for such staging areas.  
  
    6.8.2  Construction Phase Approvals and Control of Work.  In addition  
    to its right to approve the Building design and specifications, the  
    City shall have the right to approve, in advance and in writing, any  
    proposed changes to the work during construction that would cause the  
    Building to exceed the Project Budget for that portion of the Project  
    or that would result in a change contrary to the requirements  
    established by the City's Landmarks Board or any other adopted City or  
    DPR standards or design program.  The City's approval decision under  
    this Article shall be delivered within five (5) working days.  In  
    addition, each party will invite the non-managing party to participate  
    in their weekly construction meetings.  
  
    6.9 Substantial Completion.  Audubon shall notify the City Project  
    Manager in writing when the Building is substantially completed.  As  
    part of such notification, Audubon shall advise the City Project  
    Manager of any items of work that remain incomplete and a schedule for  
    their completion.  Such notification shall include the signature of  
    the inspector approved by the City pursuant to Article 6.4 above.  
  
    6.10 Final Completion Date; Certificate of Occupancy.  Final  
    completion of the Building will have been achieved when (i) a  
    permanent Certificate of Occupancy for the Building has been issued,  
    and (ii) all remaining work items, including "punch list" items, have  
    been completed to the satisfaction of the City.  
  
    6.10.1  Audubon shall schedule a final inspection of the Building when  
    it and its construction contractor believe construction of the  
    Building has been finally completed.  Following notice of same from  
    Audubon, the City Project Manager will conduct an inspection of the  
    Building with Audubon and its design consultant and construction  
    contractor.  
  
    If, following such inspection, the City agrees that construction of  
    the Building is finally complete, the City will so advise Audubon by  
    written notice within five business days after the inspection.  Such  
    written notice will include a Final Completion Date for the Building,  
    as determined by the City .  However, if the City, following such  
    inspection, does not reasonably consider the construction of the  
    Building to be finally complete, the City will so advise AUDUBON by  
    written notice within such five day period stating the reasons for the  
    City's decision.  
  
    Upon receipt of any written notice from the City that the construction  
    of the Building is not finally complete, Audubon shall diligently  
    pursue the remaining work necessary to achieve final completion.  
    Subsequent inspection(s) for purposes of determining whether  
    construction of the Building is finally completed shall occur in the  
    manner set forth above.  
  
    6.10.2  Once a permanent Certificate of Occupancy has been issued and  
    a Final Completion Date for the Building has been established, a  
    Certificate of Final Completion will be issued by the City; provided,  
    however, that such date and certificate shall not constitute  
    acceptance by the City of any unauthorized or defective work or  
    materials.  
  
    6.11 Building Construction Closeout Phase.  The Building Construction  
    Closeout Phase will commence upon issuance of the Certificate of Final  
    Completion for the Building.  
  
    Within 120 days from the date of the issuance of the Certificate of  
    Final Completion, Audubon shall perform the following obligations  
    ("Audubon's Closeout Obligations"):  
  
    (a)  To the extent separately assignable, assign to the City all  
    manufacturers' guaranties and warranties and related to the materials  
    and fixtures provided to Audubon and located in the Building;  
  
    (b)  Secure and deliver to the City unconditional lien releases  
    related to the Building from the Building design consultant,  
    construction contractor, subcontractors, suppliers, vendors, laborers  
    and material men;  
  
    (c)  Furnish the City with one (1) original complete sets of Mylar  
    drawings ("Record Drawings") reflecting the final "as built" condition  
    of the Building (black background prints are not acceptable).  The  
    Record Drawings shall also be provided to the City on electronic media  
    that is compatible with Auto Cad 2000 or later version;  
  
    (d)  Furnish the City with all contractor maintenance manuals related  
    to the Building, including operating manuals, equipment brochures,  
    paint schedules and material brochures;  
  
    (e)  Deliver to the City all other Building information such as  
    operating manuals and warranties and in Audubon's possession that  
    reasonably relate to the use and operation of the Building;  
  
    (f)  Deliver to the City all certificates of occupancy and other  
    permits and approvals necessary for the use and operation of the  
    Building ; and  
  
    (g)  Attend a warranty walk through meeting scheduled by the City  
    within one year of the  issuance of the Certificate of Final  
    Completion.  
  
    6.12 Defective or Unauthorized Work or Materials.  If, within one year  
    after the issuance of the Certificate of Final Completion, the City  
    notifies Audubon that it has discovered defective or unauthorized work  
    or materials, Audubon shall cause the correction of  the defective or  
    unauthorized work or materials as covered by the bond described in  
    Article 9.3.3 (b) or, at the City's discretion, assign the right for  
    the City to pursue Audubon's contractor or supplier thereof.   Any  
    disputes between Audubon and the City regarding the defective or  
    unauthorized work or materials will be addressed through Article 13  
    (Disputes).  
  
    ARTICLE 7 ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITY  
  
    7.1 Audubon's Environmental Indemnity.  If, after the commencement of  
    construction on the Building, any act, omission or negligence of  
    Audubon or any of its agents results in any contamination of the  
    Premises, the Building or the surrounding property or in the Release  
    of Hazardous Material from, on, in, on or beneath the Premises, the  
    Building or adjacent property, then Audubon shall indemnify the City  
    from and against all losses (including, without limitation, the loss  
    or restriction of the use of the Building or adjacent property and  
    sums paid in settlement of claims, fines, civil penalties, attorneys'  
    fees, consultants' fees and experts' fees and costs) resulting from  
    such Release.  The foregoing indemnity includes, without limitation,  
    costs incurred in connection with the investigation of site conditions  
    and all activities required to locate, assess, evaluate, remediate,  
    clean up, remove, contain, treat, stabilize, monitor or otherwise  
    control any Hazardous Material, and to restore the Building or  
    adjacent property to its prior condition.  Without limiting the  
    foregoing, if Audubon or any of its agents or invitees causes or  
    permits the Release of any Hazardous Materials on, about, in or  
    beneath the Building or adjacent property, Audubon shall immediately,  
    at no expense to the City, take any and all necessary actions to abate  
    and remediate the Release in accordance with all Environmental Laws.  
    Audubon shall afford the City a full opportunity to participate in any  
    discussions with governmental regulatory agencies regarding any  
    settlement agreement, cleanup or abatement agreement, consent decree,  
    or other compromise or proceeding involving Hazardous Material.  This  
    indemnity provision shall survive termination or expiration of this  
    Agreement.  
  
    7.2 City's Environmental Indemnity.  If any act, omission or  
    negligence occurring prior to the commencement of Audubon's  
    construction activities, and not as a result of any act, omission or  
    negligence of Audubon or any of its agents, results or has resulted in  
    any contamination of the Building or the surrounding property or in  
    the Release of Hazardous Material from, on, in, or beneath the  
    Building or adjacent property, then the City shall indemnify Audubon  
    from and against all losses (including, without limitation, the loss  
    or restriction of the use of the Building and delays in the  
    construction of the Building and sums paid in fines, civil penalties,  
    attorneys' fees, consultants' fees and experts' fees and costs)  
    resulting from such Release.  The foregoing indemnity includes,  
    without limitation, costs incurred in connection with the  
    investigation of site conditions and all activities required to  
    locate, assess, evaluate, remediate, cleanup, remove, contain, treat,  
    stabilize, monitor or otherwise control any Hazardous Material and any  
    increased costs of construction of the Building resulting from such  
    Release.   The City's indemnity under this Article shall be limited to  
    any contamination of the Premises or adjacent property that results  
    from activities occurring or causes originating prior to the  
    commencement of Audubon's construction activities and not as a result  
    of any act, omission or negligence of Audubon or any of its agents.  
    This indemnity provision shall survive termination or expiration of  
    this Agreement.  
  
    ARTICLE 8  REPORTS; APPLICATIONS FOR PAYMENT.  
  
    8.1 Invoicing.  During the design phase of the Building portion of the  
    Project, Audubon's Project representative shall invoice DPR's Project  
    Manager for the City's portion of the Building's design contract.  The  
    total amount of the City's contribution to the Building's design  
    contract is $20,406 or approximately 12.6% of the total estimated  
    design contract amount of $161,642.  As the City has already expended  
    or encumbered $4,063 of the Building's design costs, the remaining  
    balance for which the City shall be responsible is $16,343.  Audubon  
    shall bill the City at the rate of 12.6% of the Building's design  
    contract costs as they are incurred by Audubon until the City's  
    remaining funding obligation of $16,342 is expended.  Each invoice  
    shall contain a general status report, the percent of each design  
    phase completed and the balance of funds remaining for design.  
  
    During the construction phase for the Building, the City will be  
    contributing $248,230 (or 26.85%) of the budgeted construction  
    contract costs.  Audubon's Project Representative shall invoice the  
    City at 26.85% of the construction contractor's costs as Audubon  
    incurs such costs.  Each invoice shall contain a general status  
    report, the inspector's report and a statement of the balance of funds  
    remaining for construction.  
  
    8.1.1 Audubon may submit monthly requests for payment (invoices) to  
    the City based upon (and not in excess of) the percentage of work  
    completed as a percentage of the City's contribution to the Building's  
    construction, based on a mutually agreed upon schedule of values.  
    Audubon shall withhold a retained percentage from their construction  
    contractor and not bill the City for their portion of the retainage  
    until Audubon pays the contractor for the retained amounts.  
  
    8.1.2 Payment requests shall be directed to the City at the Parks and  
    Recreation Department, 800 Maynard Avenue South, Third Floor, Seattle,  
    WA 98134-1336, and shall be signed by an authorized representative of  
    Audubon.  The Superintendent, or a designated representative, shall  
    approve or disapprove the request, in writing, within ten (10) working  
    days of receipt of all required documentation.  If the payment request  
    is disapproved, the notice thereof shall contain the reasons for the  
    disapproval; Audubon may correct the reasons for disapproval and  
    resubmit the request for disapproved items.  Payment will be made to  
    Audubon within thirty (30) days after notice of the Superintendent's  
    approval.  The City will use its best efforts to expedite this payment  
    process so that payment can be made as quickly as possible to Audubon.  
  
    8.2 City Audits.  Upon request, Audubon (including any assignees of  
    rights or responsibilities under this Agreement) shall permit the City  
    to inspect and audit all pertinent books and records of Audubon, its  
    assignees, its consultants and contractors, any subcontractors, or any  
    other person or entity that performed work in connection with or  
    related to the Project, at any and all times deemed necessary by the  
    City, including up to six years after the final payment has been made  
    by the City under this Agreement.  Such inspection and audit shall  
    occur in King County, Washington or other such reasonable location as  
    the City selects.  Audubon shall supply the City with, or shall permit  
    the City to make a copy of, any books and records or portion thereof.  
    Audubon shall ensure that such inspection, audit and copying right of  
    the City is a condition of any contract or agreement, subcontract, or  
    other arrangement under which any other person or entity is permitted  
    to perform work under this Agreement.  
  
    8.3 DPR Reports to Audubon.  During construction of the Hatchery  
    improvements, DPR shall report to Audubon monthly on the general  
    status of the project, the schedule and value statement provided by  
    the contractor, the inspector's report, and the unexpended amount of  
    City funds for that portion of the Project.  
  
    ARTICLE 9 INSURANCE  
  
    9.1 General Obligations.  At all time hereunder, Audubon shall, at its  
    own expense, obtain and continuously maintain, or cause to be obtained  
    and continuously maintained, in full force and effect, insurance  
    policy(ies) in conjunction with the following:  
  
    (a)  Audubon's activity on or use or occupation of the Project site;  
  
    (b)  the design, construction management, inspection, construction,  
    reconstruction, operation, maintenance, use or existence of the  
    Project, including the Annex; and  
  
    c)  Any and all claims and risks in connection with the activities  
    performed by Audubon under this Agreement.  
  
    9.2 Third Party Obligations.  With respect to all consultants and  
    contractors performing Project work on behalf of Audubon, Audubon  
    shall:

    City and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and

    expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred in connection with any  
    third party claims arising from any use of donated funds for a purpose  
    other than the purpose originally set forth by the donor, or for any  
    other act or omission of Audubon in connection with fulfilling its  
    obligations under this Agreement.  These indemnification obligations  
    shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.  
  
    10.2 City Indemnity.  City agrees to defend, indemnify and hold  
    Audubon and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and  
    independent contractors harmless from any and all damages, costs and

    claims arising from any act or omission of City in connection with  
    fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement.  These  
    indemnification obligations shall survive the expiration or  
    termination of this Agreement.  
  
    ARTICLE 11 DEFAULT; TERMINATION  
  
    11.1 Defaults in Performance Constitute Material Breach.   If either  
    party defaults in performing of any of its obligations herein, in  
    particular obligations relating to the payment of money, the non-  
    defaulting party may declare this Agreement to have been materially  
    breached.  
  
    11.2 Process for Termination of Agreement.  Either party may terminate  
    this Agreement if the other party has materially breached the  
    Agreement and such breach has not been corrected to the reasonable  
    satisfaction of the dissatisfied party within thirty (30) days after  
    notice of breach has been given.  If the nature of the breach is such  
    that more than thirty (30) days are required to remedy the breach,  
    then the breaching party shall not be in default if it commences to  
    cure the breach within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter  
    diligently prosecutes the same to completion.  In the case of  
    Audubon's monetary obligations, any nonpayment when due shall  
    constitute a material breach that must be corrected within 30 days  
    after notice of the breach has been given or the City may immediately  
    terminate this Agreement.

    prior to start of construction, then Audubon shall reimburse the City  
    for one hundred percent (100%) of the City's expended financial  
    contribution to the Project.  If this Agreement is terminated due to  
    the City's default prior to the start of construction, then the City  
    will reimburse Audubon for Audubon's expended financial contribution  
    to the Project.  In either case, the parties shall be released from  
    all continuing obligations under the Use and Occupancy Agreement.   If  
    this Agreement is terminated due to Audubon's default after  
    construction begins, Audubon shall be obligated to satisfy its  
    commitments as contained in Article 3.2 (Usable Building Commitment)  
    of this Agreement.    If this Agreement is terminated due to the  
    City's default after construction begins but before the term of the  
    Use and Occupancy Agreement has commenced, the City shall be obligated  
    to reimburse Audubon for one hundred percent (100%) of Audubon's  
    expended financial contribution to the design and construction of the  
    Building and shall release Audubon from all continuing obligations  
    under the Use and Occupancy Agreement.  For purposes of this Article  
    11.4, the term "financial contribution" shall mean a party's paid or  
    incurred expenses pursuant to the Project Budget as reflected in  
    Exhibit C or as amended by mutual agreement.  
  
    11.5 Termination for Contamination or Release of Hazardous Substances.  
    If, during either design or construction, Audubon discovers the  
    existence of any contamination of the Building or the surrounding  
    property or the existence of a Release of Hazardous Material from, on,  
    in, on or beneath the Building or adjacent property, which is the  
    result of any act or omission occurring prior to the commencement of  
    Audubon's construction activities, and not as a result of any act,  
    omission or negligence of Audubon or any of its agents, and such  
    contamination or Release requires Remediation Activities or results in  
    an increase in the Project Budget for the Building, Audubon shall have  
    the right to immediately terminate this Agreement and the City shall  
    be obligated to indemnify Audubon consistent with Article 7.2 above  
    (City's Environmental Indemnity) and shall release Audubon from all  
    continuing obligations under the Use and Occupancy Agreement.  
  
    11.6 Voluntary Termination by Audubon.  In the event that Audubon is  
    no longer able to carry out the purposes of this Agreement because of  
    (a) corporate incapacity, (b) lack of funds to design or construct the  
    Building, (c) failure to obtain the necessary permits and licenses  
    from applicable governmental authorities after the diligent pursuit of  
    same, or (d) the discovery of Hazardous Materials in the Building that  
    predate the Commencement Date (in which case, Article 11.5 applies),

    thirty (30) days written notice to the City.  If Audubon terminates  
    this Agreement as provided for herein, the requirements of Article  
    11.4 above shall apply as applicable; provided that, Article 11.4  
    shall not be deemed to apply in the event that termination is  
    necessary pursuant to item (c) of this Article 11.6.  For the sole  
    purpose of applying Article 11.4 to this Article 11.6, Audubon shall  
    be deemed the "defaulting party".

    including office space, limited retail transactions, storage,  
    exhibits, and fundraising events.  
  
    IV. TERM  
  
    This Use Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, subject to  
    the Form of Amendment.  The term of occupancy ("Term") shall commence  
    upon execution of the Form of Amendment ("Occupancy Date") and shall  
    terminate 10 years thereafter, as set forth in the Form of Amendment,  
    unless sooner terminated as provided herein.  If Audubon is not in  
    default with respect to any material provision of this Use Agreement,  
    Audubon shall have the right to extend the Term for up to ten (10)  
    additional years upon the same terms and conditions contained herein  
    except that the Fixed Rent shall be adjusted based on the then-current  
    fair rental value of the Premises as determined by an MAI-certified  
    appraiser hired by the City at its expense and in consideration of any  
    adjustment thereto as specified in ArticleV.  In no event, however,  
    shall the Fixed Rent for the first year of the extended term be less  
    than the Fixed Rent paid during the last year of the original Use  
    Agreement Term.  
  
    V. RENT  
  
    A. Fixed Rent.  
  
    Prior to executing the Form of Amendment, the City shall set a fair  
    market rental value for the Premises and for use of the Building  
    Common Areas and the Hatchery Program Areas based on the fair market  
    rental value of the Premises plus one-half (1/2) of the fair market  
    rental value of the Building Common Areas and one-third (1/3) of the  
    fair market rental value of the Hatchery Program Areas, which will not  
    exceed a cost of $1.35 per square foot per month, escalated by the  
    Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers as defined in Article VB  
    which shall be no more than 4% each year from 2003 until the date of  
    execution of the Form of Amendment.  The determinants for the fair  
    market rental value shall include all applicable restrictions on the  
    use of the Building and the Hatchery Program Area (the "Fixed Rent").  
  
    B. Adjusted Fixed Rent.  
  
    Commencing on the aniversary date of the execution of the Form of  
    Amendment, the annual Fixed Rent shall be adjusted each year by the  
    percentage increase that occurred during the preceding calendar year  
    ("Adjustment Percentage") in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban  
    Consumers ("CPI-U" / 1982-84 = 100) Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton  
    Metropolitan Area ("Index"), using the base 1982-84 = 100, as  
    published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department  
    of Labor, or its successor (the "CPI Increase") provided that the  
    percentage increase does not exceed 4% each year.  The result shall be  
    known as the "Adjusted Fixed Rent".  Should any year's CPI percentage  
    change be less than zero, the change to the Fixed Rent for that year  
    shall be set at zero percent (0%).  Therefore, in no case shall any  
    year's Fixed Rent be less than the prior year's amount.  In the event  
    of any change in the Index base (1982-84=100) or other modification of  
    the CPI Index, or in the event the CPI is discontinued, the  
    Superintendent shall select a similar index of comparable statistics  
    on the cost of living for King County as shall be computed by an  
    agency of the United States or by a responsible financial periodical  
    or other recognized authority.  
  
    C. Rental Offsets.  
  
    1.  Improvement Expenditure Offset.  For the duration of this Use  
    Agreement, including any extended term, Audubon shall be entitled to  
    an offset against the Adjusted Fixed Rent for the total amount of  
    Audubon's capital expenditures for the design and construction of the  
    Building pursuant to the Project Budget in Exhibit C of the  
    Development Agreement.  The offset shall be credited against the  
    Adjusted Fixed Rent over the term of this Use Agreement.  The parties  
    agree that to the extent that Audubon's capital expenditures exceed  
    the amount of the Adjusted Fixed Rent, the excess shall be a gift to  
    the City.  
  
    2.  Public Benefit Offset.  For the duration of this Use Agreement,  
    including any extended term, Audubon shall be entitled to an offset  
    against the Adjusted Fixed Rent for the value of the Public Benefit  
    Components of Audubon's program at Seward Park, as described in  
    Article VIII, below.  The offset shall be credited against the  
    Adjusted Fixed Rent over the term of this Use Agreement, with the  
    value being determined each year by the value of Audubon's fee  
    discounts, scholarships, programming, and stewardship activities, all  
    as reported in Audubon's Program Audit Report described in Article  
    XXXIII.  
  
    D. Annual Rent.  
  
    The Annual Rent shall be determined based upon the Adjusted Fixed Rent  
    less any Improvement Expenditure Offset credit and less any Public  
    Benefit Offset credit.  
  
    VI. TAXES, UTILITIES AND OTHER SERVICES  
  
    A. Taxes.  
  
    Audubon shall pay, before delinquency, all applicable taxes, levies,  
    and assessments arising from its activities on or occupancy of the  
    Premises, including, but not limited to any taxes arising out of the  
    activity or business conducted on the Premises such as the rental or  
    sale of goods or services; taxes levied on its property, equipment,  
    and improvements on the Premises; and taxes on Audubon's interest  
    under this Use Agreement and any leasehold interest deemed to have  
    been created thereby under Ch. 82.29A RCW (collectively, "Taxes").  If  
    the State of Washington makes any demand upon the City as City for  
    payment of leasehold excise taxes resulting from Audubon's occupation  
    of the Premises or withholds funds due to the City to enforce  
    collection of leasehold excise taxes Audubon shall remit the taxes  
    demanded together with any interest and penalties associated therewith  
    or, at no expense to the City, contest such collection action and  
    indemnify the City for all sums reasonably expended by, or withheld by  
    the State of Washington from the City, in connection with such taxes.  
  
    B. Fixed Rent Reduction and Offset Inapplicable to Taxes.  
  
    The reduction and offsetting of any Fixed Rent pursuant to Article  
    V.C. shall have no effect on the amount of any leasehold excise tax  
    due and payable to the City or any other tax obligation of Audubon.  
    Unless Audubon is exempt from the payment of Leasehold excise taxes,  
    all such taxes shall be paid only in cash.

    if any, electricity, gas, water, sewer, garbage and recycling,  
    heating, Building Common Area janitorial, and security alarm costs.  
    DPR shall pay the costs of all utilities to the Hatchery.   Audubon  
    shall not install additional utilities without the City's Approval,  
    which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
  
    D. Telephone and Data Transmission.  
  
    With the Superintendent's Approval, Audubon may install customary  
    telephone and data communication systems to secure service to the  
    Premises for Audubon's use.  Audubon shall pay for such services  
    directly to the appropriate telephone or data processing company or  
    other service provider.  
  
    E. No City Liability.  
  
    The  City shall not be liable for any injury, loss or damage caused by  
    or resulting from any interruption or failure of utility services due  
    to any causes whatsoever, other than the City's gross negligence.  
    Audubon shall not be entitled to an offset, reduction, or return of  
    Fixed Rent as a result of any interruption or failure of said  
    services.  
  
    VII. PROCESS FOR PAYMENT OF RENT AND OTHER EXPENSES  
  
    A. Time for Payment of Annual Rent.  
  
    Annual Rent shall be paid annually, commencing on the Occupancy Date  
    and on each anniversary of the Occupancy Date thereafter within thirty  
    days from the date of an invoice from the City setting forth the  
    Annual Rent amount and the calculation thereof.  Prior to the City's  
    calculation of the Annual Rent, Audubon shall submit an estimate of  
    the projected value of the Public Benefit Offset for the forthcoming  
    year.  This estimate will be evaluated against the Program Audit  
    provided by Audubon at the end of the year and any required  
    adjustments in the rent shall be made retroactively.  
  
    B. Utility and Other Service Charges.  
  
    The City shall invoice Audubon monthly for utilities and other  
    services provided hereunder.  Audubon shall pay such invoices within  
    thirty (30) days of the date of each invoice.  
  
    C. Program and Building Use Receipts.  
  
    All funds collected by Audubon from third parties on behalf of the  
    City shall be remitted to the City within forty-eight (48) hours of

    Audubon shall also pay to the City a rate of interest to be charged on  
    delinquent accounts as established by Ordinance 117969 or any  
    successor ordinance, the provisions of which are incorporated herein  
    by reference.  Audubon shall pay the City Twenty Dollars ($20.00) for  
    each check refused payment for insufficient funds or any other reason.  
  
    E. Payment Process.  
  
    All payments due to the City under this Use Agreement shall be shall

    VIII. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS  
  
    A. Programs.  
  
    Consistent with Audubon's mission, Audubon's programs shall be  
    community-responsive, particularly to South Seattle communities, and  
    shall provide inquiry-based, hands-on, direct experience in nature  
    programs for families, children, youth and adults. Membership in the  
    Audubon Society shall not be a prerequisite for participation.  The  
    programs shall be:  
  
    (i)  focused on and relevant to the local community;  
  
    (ii)  culturally inclusive of diverse perspectives and relationships  
    with the environment;  
  
    (iii)  respectful of the natural and human history of Seward Park and  
    all living things;  
  
    (iv)  designed to sustain the natural resources at Seward Park;  
  
    (v)  compatible with and supportive of the City's environmental  
    stewardship programs, particularly the TREC and Naturalist programs;  
  
    (vi) action and result-oriented; and  
  
    (vii) designed to minimize the need for vehicle access to the  
    Hatchery.  
  
    B. Coordination.  
  
    The City and Audubon shall coordinate their environmental education  
    programs and other activities within the Building and other areas of  
    Seward Park to avoid overuse and conflicts in scheduling through  
    monthly meetings or other mutually agreed means of coordination  
    between relevant personnel of Audubon and DPR.  Audubon shall meet  
    with representative of DPR's TREC program and reach consensus on the  
    scheduling of Audubon activities in a manner that is compatible with  
    the on-going activities of that program.  
  
    C. Community Outreach.  
  
    Audubon shall reach out to local citizens and community groups, with  
    emphasis on diverse ethnic, racial, cultural and economic populations  
    and historically underserved communities, to maximize opportunities  
    for all citizens to be involved in the planning, delivery and use of  
    Audubon's educational and nature program services.  Audubon shall  
    report to the City on these outreach activities on an annual basis  
    through the audit process described in Article XXXIII.  
  
    D. Access.  
  
    Audubon agrees to operate its programs and activities at Seward Park  
    with the goal of providing the widest possible access to the general  
    public while at the same time maintaining the feasibility of the  
    Audubon programs and activities.  In furtherance of that goal, Audubon  
    shall ensure that its Seward Park programs shall be affordable and  
    accessible to the public, including low-income park users, children  
    and school-age students.  Audubon program fees shall be competitive  
    with City fees for programs of similar scope and quality, and a  
    schedule of Audubon program fees shall be submitted to the City  
    annually along with an annual plan that outlines how Audubon shall  
    ensure affordability (i.e., level of scholarships and fees) for the  
    City's review.  At the end of the year, Audubon shall report on the  
    actual level of affordability in the Program Audit report described in  
    Article XXXIII.  
  
    E. Public Use of Building Common Areas.  
  
    Without displacing DPR's TREC and Naturalist programs, and ensuring  
    continued community use of the Building, Audubon shall be the central  
    user of the Building Common Areas for purposes of implementing an  
    environmental education center.  Subject to availability, the public  
    may rent meeting rooms and other Building Common Areas.  Audubon shall  
    coordinate the scheduling and collect rental fees in accordance with  
    the then current DPR rental policies.  Audubon will retain rental fees  
    as compensation for scheduling the Building's use and payment of all  
    the Building's utilities as described in Article VII.B.  Audubon shall  
    report  to DPR on a quarterly basis the number of rentals and  
    associated fees collected by Audubon.  Audubon will work to maximize  
    opportunities for the public to use the Building Common Areas,  
    particularly during evenings and weekends.   If a conflict in  
    scheduling arises, the Center Director shall work cooperatively with  
    the interested parties to negotiate a solution; provided that, an  
    aggrieved party may appeal any such determination directly to the  
    Superintendent.  
  
    F. Scheduling and Closures.  
  
    If Audubon intends to use any part of the Premises or other parts of  
    the Building or Seward Park during the hours the park is closed to the  
    public, it must obtain DPR's Approval and notify DPR security.  
  
    The City reserves and retains the right to close the Building for  
    major maintenance or repairs, or to implement public safety measures,  
    at reasonable times upon not less than seven (7) days' written notice  
    to Audubon or, in case of emergency, without notice or liability of  
    any kind; provided that no non-emergency major maintenance or repair  
    or non-emergency implementation of public safety measures shall  
    commence unless and until the parties have agreed upon a coordination  
    plan addressing the hours, terms and conditions under which such  
    action may occur.  The City agrees that Audubon shall not be charged  
    for any rent attributable to the dates when the Building is closed for  
    such purposes unless Audubon is responsible for the repairs or  
    maintenance that necessitate the closure.  
  
    G. Use Schedule.  
  
    Thirty (30) days before the end of each quarter, Audubon shall provide  
    DPR, for its Approval, a list of Audubon's proposed use dates for the  
    Hatchery and other areas in Seward Park during the succeeding quarter.  
    The list shall consist of scheduled programs, meetings, and other  
    business activities, and shall include times and dates for each  
    proposed use.  Audubon may make changes to this schedule as needed and  
    as space and scheduling permits, to accommodate its programming needs  
    and other permitted uses.  
  
    Thirty (30) days before the end of each quarter, DPR shall provide  
    Audubon, for its approval, a list of DPR's proposed use dates for the  
    Building Common Areas during the suceeding quarter.  The list shall  
    consist of scheduled programs, meetings, and other business  
    activities, and shall include times and dates for each proposed use.  
    DPR may make changes to this schedule as needed and as space and  
    scheduling permits, to accommodate its programming needs and other  
    permitted uses.  
  
    H. Staff.  
  
    1.  Loaned Naturalist.  The City shall "loan" a DPR naturalist to  
    Audubon to assist in the development and delivery of environmental  
    programs in Seward Park, consistent with the terms of this Use  
    Agreement.  The loaned employee shall remain a City employee, with all  
    the commensurate rights, responsibilities and privileges and the City  
    shall pay the salary and all required or selected employer's benefits  
    contribution for the loaned employee for up to two years, beginning on  
    the Occupancy Date.  Audubon will reimburse DPR for one-half of the  
    employee's salary and benefit costs on a monthly basis.  Audubon shall  
    pay such invoices within 30 days of the date of each invoice.  A  
    manager from DPR's Recreation and Support Division shall provide  
    supervisory support to the employee, but daily operations will be  
    managed by the  Audubon Center Director.  
  
    Either party may cancel this loan arrangement at any time, provided a  
    sixty (60) day notice of such intention is provided to the other party  
    or the parties may agree to extend the arrangement at the end of the  
    two-year period stated above.  
  
    2.  Audubon Staffing.  Audubon shall employ personnel or assign  
    volunteers in numbers that it reasonably deems appropriate and  
    necessary to conduct its environmental education and other program  
    staffing needs for its programs at Seward Park and to protect the  
    safety of program participants and the public.  Audubon may provide  
    for operation of these programs through its existing or contracted  
    staff.   At Audubon's expense, Audubon shall have the Washington State  
    Patrol conduct criminal history background checks of all potential  
    staff members before they are employed; provided that, if acceptable  
    to the Washington State Patrol, Audubon may use an independent entity  
    to provide such background checks and shall provide DPR with the  
    results of same.  Audubon shall provide DPR with a written list of its  
    state board and center staff, with telephone numbers, at the beginning  
    of each fiscal year and shall promptly notify DPR of any changes.  
  
    3. Employee Conduct.  The following shall govern employee conduct at  
    the Center:  
  
    (a)  If a complaint is filed by an Audubon employee at the Center  
    against a City employee at the Center for harassment as defined in  
    Audubon's adopted harassment policies and after investigation of such  
    complaint by Audubon, Audubon determines that a basis for such  
    complaint exists, Audubon will notify the Superintendent within 24  
    hours after the complaint is filed and the Superintendent will  
    commence an investigation and take appropriate action pursuant to  
    appropriate City ordinance and regulations.  
  
    (b) If a complaint is filed by a City employee at the Center against  
    an Audubon employee at the Center for harassment as defined in the  
    City's adopted harassment policy and after investigation of such  
    complaint by the Superintendent, the Superintendent determines that a  
    basis for such complaint exists, the Superintendent within 24 hours  
    will notify Audubon, and Audubon shall commence an investigation and  
    take appropriate action pursuant to appropriate Audubon practices and  
    procedures.  
  
    (c) If any employee at the Center is not adequately performing his or  
    her job at the Center or has other performance related issues, the  
    Center Director and the Superintendent or their designess agree to  
    discuss and resolve such issues in good faith through each entities'  
    appropriate employee review mechanisms  
  
    I. Supply Storage.  
  
    Audubon shall ensure that all of its supplies and materials are  
    appropriately stored and secured in such a way as to not unreasonably  
    inconvenience or conflict with other uses and users of the Building.  
  
    J. Intoxicating Beverages.  
  
    Audubon shall not permit intoxicating beverages of any kind to be  
    used, sold, consumed or dispensed in the Building or the Premises  
    unless the Superintendent has Approved such use, sale, consumption or  
    dispensation, in writing, and Audubon complies with all applicable  
    laws, ordinances, rules and regulations in connection therewith, as  
    now or hereafter amended.  The City acknowledges that Audubon may host  
    special events, including fundraising events, in the Building and may  
    request the Superintendent to approve the consumption or dispensation  
    of alcoholic beverages at such events, which approval shall not be  
    unreasonably withheld in connection therewith.  Prior to conducting  
    any event at which alcoholic beverages are served, Audubon shall  
    obtain insurance acceptable to the City's Risk Management Department  
    for liquor/host liability.  
  
    IX. FORCE MAJEURE  
  
    With the exception of monetary obligations, which shall not be  
    excused, Audubon shall not be in breach of its obligations under this  
    Use Agreement due to delays in the performance of its obligations  
    caused by events beyond Audubon's reasonable control and without its  
    negligence, including but not restricted to, any delays compelled by  
    court order, acts of God, acts of the public enemy, unforeseeable acts  
    of a unit of local state or federal government, unforeseeable acts or  
    omissions by other parties, fires, floods, strikes, embargoes, delays  
    in essential utility services and unusually severe weather or delays  
    of contractors or subcontractors due to such causes.  The time for the  
    performance of the obligation shall be extended for the period of the  
    delay if Audubon promptly requests an extension of time in writing  
    from City,  but in any event, within thirty (30) days after Audubon  
    becomes aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the event  
    resulting in any such delay.  
  
    X. ACCEPTANCE OF BUILDING "AS IS"  
  
    Audubon is fully familiar with the condition of the Building and the  
    Premises and accepts the Premises AS IS, subject to the  environmental  
    indemnity provisions contained in Article 7 of the Development  
    Agreement and subject to the City's environmental indemnity contained  
    in Article XIV(G).  The City makes no warranties or representations of  
    any kind with respect to the condition of the Building or the Premises  
    or their suitability for Audubon's purposes.  Audubon agrees that any  
    express or implied representations or warranties made by or on behalf  
    of the City prior to the date hereof, unless expressly set forth in  
    this Use Agreement, are hereby revoked and canceled and shall have no  
    force or effect.  Audubon further agrees that no representations or  
    warranties are implied by any provision of this Use Agreement or any  
    other words or conduct in connection with this transaction.  
  
    Audubon agrees that the City shall have no liability or obligation as  
    a result of any defect or condition of the Building or Premises,  
    including without limitation latent defects.  The City shall have no  
    obligation to undertake any repairs, maintenance or other work of any  
    kind except as expressly set forth in this Use Agreement.  
  
    Audubon and the City acknowledge that this Article has been  
    specifically bargained for and that the City would not be willing to  
    Lease the Premises on the terms and conditions set forth herein  
    without Audubon's agreement to the terms of this Article.  
  
    XI.  MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS  
  
    A. Audubon's Cleaning and Maintenance Obligations.  
  
    1.  Audubon shall at all times keep the Premises and Building Common  
    Areas in a neat, clean, safe and sanitary condition, with normal wear  
    and tear and damage and destruction by fire and other extraordinary  
    casualty excepted, and shall use and maintain the Premises and  
    Building Common Areas in accordance with all codes, the laws of the  
    State of Washington and the Charter and ordinances of The City of  
    Seattle, and in accordance with all valid directives, rules and  
    regulations issued by any authorized City or State officer.  Audubon  
    shall not cause or permit any waste, damage, or injury to the Building  
    or the Premises; use or permit on or in the Building or the Premises  
    anything that will increase the rate of fire insurance thereon;  
    maintain anything on or in the Building or the Premises that may be  
    dangerous to life or limb; overload the floors; permit any  
    objectionable noise or odor to escape or to be emitted from the  
    Building or the Premises; or permit anything to be done in or around  
    the Building or the Premises that in any way will tend to create a  
    nuisance, or interfere with access to and from Seward Park or any part  
    thereof.  If the Superintendent has a good faith belief that any  
    activity occurring on the Premises presents an imminent threat to  
    public health or safety, then after consultation with the Audubon  
    Center Director, the Superintendent may order such activity to  
    immediately cease, without liability to the City for such  
    interruption, until such threat has been adequately evaluated or  
    remedied, as the case may be.  
  
    2.  If requested by Audubon, the City may maintain, clean and repair  
    the Premises to the ordinary standards provided to other DPR tenants  
    occupying similar facilities, or as otherwise agreed upon by the  
    parties, and shall keep the same in good condition, normal wear and  
    tear and damage and destruction by fire and other extraordinary  
    casualty excepted.  Audubon shall pay the cost of maintaining,  
    cleaning and repairing the Premises as well any extraordinary costs of  
    cleaning, repairing or maintaining the Building Common Areas or the  
    Building, occasioned by Audubon's use and occupancy thereof, within 30  
    days after receipt of an invoice therefor.  
  
    3. Audubon shall implement, at no cost or expense to the City, a  
    preventive maintenance custodial care program that is consistent with  
    other similar DPR facilities and operations and as determined by the  
    Superintendent.  Audubon shall be informed of such preventative  
    maintenance custodial care obligations prior to Audubon's occupancy of  
    the Premises.  
  
    Audubon shall participate in an annual inspection of the Building and  
    the Premises with the Maintenance Services division of DPR and be  
    responsible, except where the City is obligated under the terms of  
    this Use Agreement to be so responsible, for taking any and all action  
    that may be reasonably required to maintain and operate the Premises  
    in accordance with the then current DPR standards, a current example  
    of such standards is attached hereto as Exhibit v, and Audubon's  
    obligations under this Use Agreement.  DPR shall notify Audubon ninety  
    (90) days in advance of any proposed DPR standards changes that may  
    impact Audubon's obligations under this Use Agreement.  
  
    4.  The City reserves for itself, its officers, employees, agents and  
    contractors, free access to the Premises, at all reasonable times upon  
    reasonable notice for purposes of inspecting, cleaning, or making  
    repairs, to the Premises or any other property owned by or under the  
    control of the City, including additions or alterations to City  
    property other than the Premises, but this right shall not be  
    construed as an agreement on the part of the City to make inspections,  
    clean or make repairs, additions or alterations except as specifically  
    provided elsewhere in this Use Agreement.  Audubon shall reimburse  
    City on demand for the cost of any such repairs or alterations  
    resulting from Audubon's activities, reasonable wear and tear  
    excepted; provided that, the City shall provide notice to Audubon of  
    the need for such repairs or alterations and shall afford Audubon the  
    option of performing such repairs or alterations.  The  City also  
    reserves the right to make alterations to the Building Common Areas at  
    no cost to Audubon where such alterations will not unreasonably  
    interfere with Audubon's ordinary operation of the Premises or use of  
    the Building Common Areas.  
  
    B. City's Maintenance Obligations  
  
    The City shall maintain the Building, including but not limited to  
    electrical and mechanical systems (heating, plumbing, ventilation),  
    the roof, exterior shell, and exterior doors, all at no cost or  
    expense to Audubon.  The City shall be responsible for the ordinary  
    maintenance of the grounds surrounding the Building, including the  
    Seward Park areas, including lawn mowing, trimming or removal of  
    plants when required, control of noxious weeds, clearing of leaves and  
    other natural debris, and street, parking area and general access  
    maintenance.  Such maintenance shall be to the same standard, and  
    generally with the same frequency, as maintenance of other grounds and  
    general access at City parks (not including park natural areas).  
    Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, the City shall not  
    be responsible for clearing snow, ice, obstructions and hazards from  
    sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, walkways, steps, ramps and other  
    paved surfaces in Seward Park, or for repair of holes, cracks, or  
    other defects in such surfaces.  With regard to the streets serving  
    the Building and the Premises, the City shall have only such  
    obligations as the City has generally for all streets, and shall have  
    no special obligations under this Use Agreement.  The City shall also  
    be responsible for maintaining the natural resource areas of Seward  
    Park consistent with, at a minimum, the policies for Park Management  
    and Environmental Stewardship as contained in the adopted Parks and  
    Recreation Comprehensive Plan 2000.  
  
    C. Recycling of Waste Materials.  
  
    Audubon shall adhere to any recycling program employed by DPR at the  
    Building, and shall collect, sort and separate all solid waste  
    products and deposit the same in  receptacles provided by the City.  
  
    D. Modifications, Alterations and Additions.  
  
    1.  Throughout the Term of this Use Agreement, Audubon shall have the  
    right, at its own expense and without the prior consent of the  
    Superintendent, to install such of its own machinery and equipment, to  
    make such minor improvements and additions, and to attach such  
    removable fixtures in or upon the Premises as may be necessary to  
    conduct its permitted operations, and to remove same at any time prior  
    to the expiration or termination hereof.  As used in this Use  
    Agreement, "minor improvements and additions" means (a) ordinary  
    repairs and non-structural alterations of any portion of the Premises  
    that, individually, cost less than $5,000 or together with all other  
    items of a similar or related nature during the calendar year, cost  
    less than $15,000.00, and (b) emergency repairs immediately necessary  
    for the usual and customary usage of the Premises.  The foregoing  
    figures shall be adjusted to reflect changes in the CPI in accordance  
    with the methodology described in Article V.B.  Audubon agrees that it  
    will not divide any project into units of work to circumvent the  
    dollar restrictions stated above.  
  
    2.  Audubon shall make no modifications, alterations, additions or  
    improvements to the Premises or any part thereof the estimated cost of  
    which exceeds the limitations set forth in ArticleXID (i) (a "Major  
    Alteration"), without first obtaining the Approval of the  
    Superintendent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  In  
    exercising discretion, the Superintendent shall take into account any  
    proposed alteration or improvement that affects (a) any structural  
    portions of the Building including exterior walls, roof, foundation  
    and core of the Building; (b) the exterior of the Building or which  
    are visible from outside the Building or which are likely to increase  
    insurance costs (unless Audubon agrees to pay such increased insurance  
    costs); or (c) any of the Building systems, including elevator,  
    plumbing, air conditioning, heating, electrical, security, life safety  
    and power.  In seeking the Superintendent's Approval, Audubon shall  
    provide the Superintendent with interim plans and specifications at  
    the end of the design development and at the 50% construction document  
    stage.  Prior to any Major Alteration other than an emergency repair,  
    Audubon shall provide the Superintendent final plans and  
    specifications to which architects and engineers have affixed their  
    professional seals and signatures and such other information  
    concerning the nature and cost of the alterations as may be reasonably  
    requested by the Superintendent.  As a condition to giving such  
    consent, the Superintendent may require Audubon, among other things,  
    to undertake the work in a manner determined by the Superintendent to  
    reasonably minimize disruption to other tenants, occupants, employees  
    and users of the Building or Seward Park, to remove, if reasonably  
    possible, any such modification, alteration, improvement or addition  
    at the expiration of the Use Agreement Term and to restore the  
    Premises to its prior condition.  All such modifications, alterations,  
    additions and/or improvements shall be constructed at Audubon's sole  
    cost and expense and shall be performed in a good and workmanlike  
    manner in accordance with Superintendent-approved plans and  
    specifications and by a contractor and under a construction contract,  
    the terms and conditions of which have been approved by the  
    Superintendent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld).  Once  
    approved, no material changes shall be made to any plans and  
    specifications without the Superintendent's consent.  If the  
    Superintendent consents to any proposed modification, alteration,  
    addition or improvement to the Premises, the same shall not be a  
    warranty as to the adequacy of the design, workmanship or quality of  
    materials and the City hereby expressly disclaims any responsibility  
    or liability for the same.  If any improvement is constructed in  
    violation of this paragraph, Audubon shall either promptly make it  
    consistent with approved plans and specifications, or cease using the  
    improvement and remove it from the Premises.  Except as expressly  
    agreed by the parties, the City shall under no circumstances have any  
    obligation to repair, maintain or replace all or any portion of such  
    modifications, alterations, additions or improvements to the Premises.  
    Audubon agrees to pay as Additional Rent a reasonable sum for project  
    management costs necessarily incurred by the City with respect to  
    Major Alterations, such sum to be agreed upon by the parties as part  
    of any approval of the Major Alteration.  
  
    3.  Before commencing any work under this Article XI, Audubon,  
    regardless of whether Superintendent consent is required or not, shall  
    notify the Superintendent in writing of the expected date of  
    commencement thereof and shall require its contractor to secure, at no  
    cost to the City, a payment and performance bond as required by  
    statute, naming the City as joint obligee and insurance at least  
    equivalent to that required pursuant to Exhibit iii.  The City shall  
    then have the right at any time and from time to time to post and  
    maintain on the Premises such notices as the City reasonably deems  
    necessary to protect the Premises and the City from mechanics' liens,  
    materialmen's liens or any other liens.  Any such modification,  
    alteration, improvement or addition shall be expeditiously completed  
    in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all applicable  
    laws and regulations and the requirements of all insurance policies  
    applicable to the Premises.  Audubon shall provide the Superintendent  
    with "as-built" plans showing any Major Alteration in the Premises or  
    the Building.  Audubon shall require its contractors to maintain a  
    safe working environment at all times, including the continuation of  
    all fire and security protection devices, including fire sprinkler  
    systems and availability and operation of fire water supply lines  
    during any such construction.  All damage or injury done to the  
    Premises, the Building, or any private property in the vicinity of the  
    Building during the construction of such work by Audubon or by any  
    persons who may be in or upon the Premises or the Building with the  
    express or implied consent of Audubon and which is caused by acts or  
    omissions or Audubon or Audubon's officers, contractors,  
    subcontractors, agents, invitees, licensees, employees, successors or  
    assigns shall be paid by Audubon.  Audubon shall pay, when due, all  
    claims for labor or materials furnished to or for Audubon at or for  
    use in the Premises.  
  
    4.  All such modifications, alterations, additions or improvements  
    shall at the expiration or earlier termination of the Use Agreement  
    become the property of the City and remain upon and be surrendered  
    with the Premises.  
  
      5.  All articles of personal property, furniture and movable  
    partitions owned or installed by Audubon at its expense in the  
    Premises shall be and remain the property of Audubon and may be  
    removed by Audubon at any time during the Term of this Use Agreement  
    provided that Audubon shall, at its sole cost and expense, repair any  
    damage to the Premises caused by such removal.  
  
      6.  In undertaking any repairs, modifications, alterations,  
    additions or improvements, Audubon shall ensure that it and each of  
    its contractors and agents protects from damage or destruction private  
    and public property on or in the vicinity of the Premises that is not  
    scheduled for repair, replacement or removal.  Any property damaged by  
    Audubon or its contractors or agents in the course of any repair,  
    modification, alteration, addition or improvement shall be promptly  
    repaired or replaced at Audubon's expense.  
  
      7.  No change shall be made to electrical wiring or plumbing in the  
    Premises or to and from the Premises other than by a properly licensed  
    electrician or plumber.  
  
    E. Coordination.  
  
    The parties shall cooperate to the maximum extent possible to ensure  
    that all construction work undertaken by or on behalf of Audubon is  
    coordinated with the work of other contractors working at Seward Park,  
    Seward Park tenants and with routinely scheduled events and  
    activities.  No construction work of any kind shall commence unless  
    and until the parties have agreed upon a coordination plan addressing  
    the hours, terms and conditions under which such construction may  
    occur.  Audubon shall work closely with the Superintendent or his/her  
    designee to schedule construction activity to minimize construction  
    impacts such as noise, dust and fumes.  
  
    F. City's Right to Stop Work.  
  
    Throughout the course of any construction, DPR and Audubon shall  
    consult regarding any adverse impact on Seward Park events that may  
    result from construction-related activity.  If, after consultation  
    between the Superintendent and Audubon regarding the adverse impact  
    that construction-related activity is likely to have or is actually  
    having on one or more Seward Park events and their joint effort to  
    modify or reschedule such construction-related activity so as to  
    minimize such adverse effect, the Superintendent determines, in the  
    exercise of such official's reasonable discretion, that a material  
    adverse impact is still likely to occur or is occurring, Audubon, upon  
    notice from the Superintendent, shall order the immediate suspension  
    or cessation of the construction-related activity specified in such  
    notice for the duration identified in such notice.  
  
    If, after consultation with Audubon, the Superintendent determines  
    that any work being performed upon the Premises is materially  
    inconsistent with approved construction documents or any other  
    required plan, program or rule, the Superintendent shall so notify  
    Audubon, in writing, and the parties shall endeavor to resolve the  
    situation.  If the parties are unable to devise a plan to resolve the  
    inconsistency, Audubon, upon notice from Superintendent shall order  
    the immediate suspension of the affected portion of the work until the  
    matter has been corrected.  The notice shall state the required action  
    to cure the nonconformity.  Except in cases affecting public health  
    and safety, the Superintendent will provide Audubon with at least 72  
    hours' advance written notice that it intends to issue a suspension  
    notice and provide Audubon an opportunity to cure the nonconformity.  
    Audubon shall not be entitled to damages from the City as a  
    consequence of any increased cost or time of performance attributable  
    to any such suspension, unless it is determined that the  
    Superintendent issued a suspension notice without a reasonable basis.  
  
    XII. SIGNS  
  
    A. Name of Building and Use of Name.  
  
    For the term of the Use Agreement, the Building will be named "Seward  
    Park Environmental  and Audubon Center" to reflect the partnership and  
    the programs housed in the Building.  Such name will be used on signs  
    identifying the Building and, to the extent practicable, in  
    promotional and other marketing materials specifically relating to  
    Audubon's or the City's activities or events at the Building.  The  
    Audubon Center will be operated solely by Audubon, will identify  
    itself as an Audubon Center consistent with the branding and identity  
    program of other Audubon Centers around the country, and will use as  
    its symbol a logo that is a trademark of Audubon and used by Audubon.  
    The City acknowledges Audubon's exclusive right, title and interest in  
    and to the trade and corporate name "National Audubon Society" and the  
    trademarks "Audubon" and "Audubon Center" ("Audubon Marks"), and  
    acknowledges that any use of the Audubon Marks without the benefit of  
    a license agreement is an infringement of Audubon's rights and  
    constitutes unfair competition.  While this Use Agreement is in effect  
    and thereafter, the City will not in any manner represent that it has  
    any interest in the Audubon Marks; will not contest Audubon's  
    exclusive right, title and interest in and to, or the validity of, the  
    Audubon Marks; and will not act in any manner inconsistent with  
    Audubon's indivisible ownership of the Audubon Marks.  
  
    B. Audubon Signs.  
  
    Audubon may, upon Approval from DPR, which consent shall not be  
    unreasonably withheld, install bulletin boards and other signs or  
    postings within the Building Common Areas and display community-  
    related notices, posters, and similar materials related to Audubon's  
    operations within the Building.  Audubon shall also have the right to  
    place and maintain, within the Premises, any bulletin boards, signs or  
    postings and any plaques or other displays of the names of the donors  
    or contributors to the Audubon Center at Seward Park; provided that,  
    any such postings shall be subject to the City's Ethics Commission  
    prohibitions on certain signage in public buildings.  Audubon shall  
    not, without the Superintendent's Approval, install any signs on the  
    exterior of the Building.  
  
    XIII. KEYS  
  
    In accordance with DPR Administrative Policy 2.71, attached hereto as  
    Exhibit iv, Audubon will obtain, account for and collect keys from DPR  
    to the exterior door(s) of the Building at the time of occupancy and  
    after any change in the locks of the exterior doors.  Any change in  
    locks for the Premises shall be at Audubon's expense.  If a lock  
    change is made to any exterior door of the Premises, Audubon shall  
    provide the Superintendent with one (1) key for each lock changed  
    immediately after such change has been completed.  Audubon shall  
    account for and collect keys in accordance with Exhibit iv.  
  
    XIV. HAZARDOUS WASTE OR MATERIALS  
  
    A. Restriction on Use; Response Plan; Definition.  
  
    Audubon shall not cause or permit any Hazardous Material to be brought  
    upon, kept, used, stored, generated or disposed of in, on or about the  
    Premises or the Building, or any adjacent property.  Audubon  
    represents, warrants and agrees that Audubon's uses of the Premises,  
    the Building and the Seward Park Common Areas (including uses by  
    invitees or licensees) shall not involve the use, production, or  
    disposal of any hazardous substances, except for cleaning and  
    maintenance supplies normally used in the operation of similar  
    buildings that shall be used, stored and disposed of in compliance  
    with all applicable laws, regulations and prudent practices.  If  
    Audubon is granted permission to bring any Hazardous Material (other  
    than such cleaning and maintenance supplies) into the Building or the  
    Premises, then before doing so, Audubon shall prepare and submit to  
    the City a hazardous materials response plan acceptable to the City.  
    Audubon shall comply fully with such plan, at Audubon's sole expense.  
  
    B. Compliance.  
  
    Audubon, at its sole expense, shall promptly comply with all  
    Environmental Laws relating to the use, collection, treatment,  
    disposal, storage, control, removal or cleanup of Hazardous Materials  
    either  
  
    (i)  in, on, around or under the Building if resulting from a Release  
    caused by the act or omission of Audubon or any of its employees,  
    agents, contractors, licensees or invitees.  
  
    (ii) in, on or under any other part of the Building or any adjacent  
    property or area within Seward Park if resulting from a Release caused  
    by the act or omission of Audubon or any of its employees, agents,  
    contractors, licensees or invitees.  
  
    C. City's Rights.  
  
    After notice to Audubon and a reasonable opportunity for Audubon to  
    effect such compliance as identified in Article XIV.B, the City may,  
    but is not obligated to, enter the Premises or Building and take such  
    actions and incur such costs and expenses to comply with any  
    Environmental Laws regarding Hazardous Material as the City deems  
    advisable to protect its interests, provided, however, that the City  
    shall not be obligated to give Audubon notice and an opportunity to  
    effect such compliance if (i) such delay might result in material  
    harm, (ii) Audubon has actual knowledge of the situation and has had a  
    reasonable opportunity to effect such compliance, or (iii) an  
    emergency exists.  Whether or not Audubon has actual knowledge of the  
    presence or Release of a Hazardous Material, Audubon shall reimburse  
    the City on demand for the full amount of all costs and expenses  
    incurred by the City in connection with compliance activities, and  
    such obligation shall continue even after the termination of this Use  
    Agreement.  
  
    D. Audubon's Duty to Notify; Response to Release.  
  
    Audubon shall notify the City immediately of the presence or Release  
    of any Hazardous Material (other than Hazardous Material permitted  
    under this Article that are stored, used, handled and disposed of in  
    compliance herewith) and shall take timely and appropriate steps to  
    protect persons and property from, and remedy the effects of, any such  
    Hazardous Material, which steps shall include immediate action in the  
    case of any Release of a Hazardous Material.  
  
    E. Removal Upon Surrender.  
  
    Upon surrender of the Premises to the City, whether upon expiration or  
    earlier termination of this Use Agreement, Audubon shall remove and  
    properly dispose of any Hazardous Material brought into the Building  
    or the Premises at any time during Audubon's occupancy of the  
    Premises, or introduced onto any part of the Building or Premises, or  
    Released on or under the Building or Premises by Audubon or any of its  
    employees, agents, contractors, licensees or invitees.  
  
    F. Audubon's Environmental Indemnity.  
  
    If Audubon breaches any of its obligations contained in this Article,  
    or, if any act, omission or negligence of Audubon or any of its agents  
    or invitees results in any contamination of the Building, Premises or  
    any other part of the adjacent property or area in Seward Park  or in  
    the Release of Hazardous Material from, on, about, in, on or beneath  
    the Premises, then Audubon shall indemnify the City from and against  
    all losses (including, without limitation, the loss or restriction of  
    the use of the Premises or adjacent property and sums paid in  
    settlement of claims, fines, civil penalties, attorneys' fees,  
    consultants' fees and experts' fees and costs) arising during or after  
    the Term of this Use Agreement and relating to such Release.  The  
    foregoing indemnity includes, without limitation, costs incurred in  
    connection with the investigation of site conditions and all  
    activities required to locate, assess, evaluate, remediate, clean up,  
    remove, contain, treat, stabilize, monitor or otherwise control any  
    Hazardous Material, and to restore the Building or adjacent property  
    or area in Seward Park to its prior condition.  Without limiting the  
    foregoing, if Audubon or any of its agents or invitees causes or  
    permits the Release of any Hazardous Materials on, about, in or  
    beneath the Premises or adjacent property, Audubon shall immediately,  
    at no expense to the City, take any and all necessary actions to abate  
    and remediate the Release in accordance with all Environmental Laws.  
    Audubon shall afford the City a full opportunity to participate in any  
    discussions with governmental regulatory agencies regarding any  
    settlement agreement, cleanup or abatement agreement, consent decree,  
    or other compromise or proceeding involving Hazardous Material.  This  
    indemnity provision shall survive termination or expiration of this  
    Use Agreement.  
  
    G.  City's Environmental Indemnity.  
  
    If any act, omission or negligence of the City or any of its agents  
    (other than Audubon) results or has resulted in any contamination of  
    the Premises or adjacent property or in the Release of Hazardous  
    Material from, on, in, on or beneath the Premises or adjacent  
    property, then the City shall indemnify Audubon from and against all  
    losses (including, without limitation, the loss or restriction of the  
    use of the Premises or the Building and sums paid in fines, civil  
    penalties, attorneys' fees, consultants' fees and experts' fees and  
    costs) arising during or after the Term of this Use Agreement and  
    resulting from such Release.  The foregoing indemnity includes,  
    without limitation, costs incurred in connection with the  
    investigation of site conditions and all activities required to  
    locate, assess, evaluate, remediate, cleanup, remove, contain, treat,  
    stabilize, monitor or otherwise control any Hazardous Material, and to  
    restore the Premises to its prior condition. The City's indemnity  
    under this Article shall include, without limitation, any  
    contamination of the Premises or adjacent property that results from  
    activities occuring or causes originating prior to the initial term of  
    this Use Agreement; provided that the City shall not be required to  
    indemnify Audubon for any contamination that is the result of any act,  
    omission or negligence of Audubon or any of its agents.  This  
    indemnification shall survive the termination or expiration of this  
    Use Agreement.  
  
    XV. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS  
  
    A. General Requirement.  
  
    Audubon, at its sole cost and expense, shall comply with all  
    applicable laws and regulations, rules and orders of the United  
    States,the State of Washington and the City of Seattle that may from  
    time to time be put into effect relating to, controlling or limiting  
    Audubon's use and operation of the Premises.  
  
    B. Licenses and Similar Authorizations.  
  
    Audubon, at its sole cost and expense, shall secure and maintain in  
    full force and effect during the Term of this Use Agreement, all  
    licenses, permits, and similar legal authorizations required for its  
    use of the Premises, and comply with all requirements thereof.  
  
    C. Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action.  
  
    Audubon shall comply with all applicable equal employment opportunity  
    and nondiscrimination laws of the United States, the State of  
    Washington, and The City of Seattle, including the Seattle Municipal  
    Code ("SMC"), notably SMC Ch. 20.44, and rules, regulations, orders,  
    and directives of the associated administrative agencies and their  
    officers.  
  
    D.  Americans with Disabilities Act.  
  
    Audubon acknowledges that the Americans with Disabilities Act (the  
    "ADA") requires that programs, services and other activities provided  
    by a public entity to the public, whether directly or through a  
    contractor, must be accessible to the disabled public.  Audubon  
    further acknowledges its obligation to comply with the ADA and any  
    other federal, state or local disability rights legislation.  Audubon  
    warrants that it will fulfill that obligation, and that it will not  
    discriminate against disabled persons in the provision of services,  
    benefits or activities pursuant to this Use Agreement.  
  
    XVI. LIENS  
  
    If, because of any act or omission of Audubon, any mechanic or other  
    lien or order for payment of money shall be filed against the Building  
    or the Premises, Audubon shall at its sole expense cause the same to  
    be discharged or bonded within thirty (30) days after the date of such  
    filing.  
  
    XVII. LIABILITY AND INSURANCE.  
  
    A. Audubon's Indemnity.  
  
    Audubon shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold the City harmless  
    from and against any and all claims (including, but not limited to  
    employee claims) and from any costs, reasonable attorneys' fees,  
    expenses and liabilities incurred in connection with such claim,  
    arising from Audubon's use of the Premises, the Building or Seward  
    Park (including any use of the Building, Premises or Park by Audubon's  
    agents, contractors or employees) or the conduct of its business, and  
    shall further protect, defend, indemnify and hold the City harmless  
    from and against any and all claims arising from any breach or default  
    in the performance of any obligation on Audubon's part to be performed  
    under the terms of this Use Agreement. Audubon, upon notice from the  
    City, shall defend the same at Audubon's expense.  Notwithstanding the  
    foregoing, if RCW 4.24.115 (or any successor provision) applies, this  
    indemnity shall apply only to the extent of Audubon's negligence or  
    that of its agents, servants or employees.  
  
    Solely with respect to claims for indemnification under this Use  
    Agreement, Audubon waives its immunity under Title 51 RCW, the  
    Industrial Insurance Act, or any other employee benefit act.  This  
    indemnification provision is the result of mutual negotiation and  
    shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  
  
    B.  City's Indemnity  
  
    The City shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold Audubon harmless  
    from and against any and all claims (including, but not limited to  
    employee claims) and from any costs, reasonable attorneys' fees,  
    expenses and liabilities incurred in connection with such claim,  
    arising from the City's negligent use of the Premises, the Building,  
    the Hatchery, or Seward Park (including any use of the Building,  
    Premises, Hatchery, or Seward Park by the City's agents, contractors  
    or employees) or the conduct of its business therein, and shall  
    further protect, defend, indemnify and hold Audubon harmless from and  
    against any and all claims arising from any breach or default in the  
    performance of any obligation on the City's part to be performed under  
    the terms of this Use Agreement. The City, upon notice from Audubon,  
    shall defend the same at the City's expense.  Notwithstanding the  
    foregoing, if RCW 4.24.115 (or any successor provision) applies, this  
    indemnity shall apply only to the extent of the City's negligence or  
    that of its agents, servants or employees.  
  
    Solely with respect to claims for indemnification under this Use  
    Agreement, the City waives its immunity under Title 51 RCW, the  
    Industrial Insurance Act, or any other employee benefit act.  This  
    indemnification provision is the result of mutual negotiation and  
    shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  
  
    C.  Insurance.  
  
    (i)  Audubon shall, at all times during the term of this Use  
    Agreement, obtain and maintain continuously, at its own expense,  
    insurance as described in Exhibit iii, and shall file with the  
    Superintendent and the City's Department of Risk Management, evidence  
    of a policy or policies of insurance as enumerated therein.  
  
    (ii)  The City shall cause its Master Use Policy to extend to the  
    Building.  The parties understand that the standard deductible for  
    such insurance is $500,000.00; however, the parties hereby agree to  
    equally share the costs for reducing the deductible to $50,000.  
  
    XVIII. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION  
  
    A. If there is any material damage or destruction to the Building or  
    the Hatchery Program areas resulting from the fault of either party,  
    then the responsible party shall be solely responsible for any  
    necessary repairs or replacemens.  
  
    B. Damage; Extent of Obligation to Restore.  If there is any material  
    damage or destruction to the Building (for purposes of this Use  
    Agreement, material damage or destruction shall mean damage or  
    destruction resulting from no fault of either party to this Use and  
    Occupancy Agreement which costs $50,000 or more to repair or replace),  
    then if the City decides not to repair or replace the damaged portion  
    of the Building and the Premises thereby become unusable, either party  
    shall have the option, upon written notice to the other, which option  
    shall be exercised within thirty (30) days of the date of such damage  
    or destruction, to terminate this Use Agreement; provided that, if  
    appliable insurance proceeds (including the City's payment of any  
    deductible as described in Article XVII(C) above) are or would have  
    been sufficient to pay the cost of reconstruction or restoration, the  
    insured party shall reconstruct or restore the damage within two (2)  
    years of the destruction.  If the Use Agreement is not terminated, it  
    shall continue in full force and effect and the City shall proceed as  
    promptly as is practicable to restore the Building to an architectural  
    unit as nearly comparable in form, fit and function as is reasonable  
    to the unit existing just prior to such damage.  If either party  
    elects to terminate the Use Agreement, such notice of termination  
    shall specify the date for termination, which date shall not be more  
    than thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice, and upon the  
    date so specified the Term of this Use Agreement shall expire as fully  
    and completely as if such date were the date hereinabove set forth for  
    the end of the Term of this Use Agreement and Audubon shall thereupon  
    vacate the Premises, without prejudice to any rights and remedies  
    accrued to the City under this Use Agreement prior to such  
    termination.  Any rent paid or payable by Audubon shall be adjusted as  
    of the date of such termination.  Should the City elect to rebuild and  
    be delayed or prevented from completing the repairs or restoration of  
    the damage to the Building after the occurrence of such damage or  
    destruction by reason of force majeure, the time for the City to  
    commence or complete repairs shall be extended for the period of force  
    majeure.  In the event of repair, reconstruction and restoration as  
    herein provided, the Annual Rent provided to be paid under this Use  
    Agreement shall be abated proportionately based upon the extent to  
    which Audubon's use of the Premises is impaired during the period of  
    such repair, reconstruction or restoration.  
  
    C. If there is any minor damage or destruction to the Building (for  
    purposes of thisUse Agreement, minor damage or destruction shall mean  
    damage or destruction which costs less than $50,000 to repair or  
    replace and is from no fault of either party), then the City shall  
    proceed as promptly as is practicable to restore the Building to as  
    nearly comparable form, fit and function as is reasonable to the unit  
    existing just prior to such damage.  
  
    Each party shall be solely responsible for the repair of any damage or  
    destruction (other than normal wear and tear) caused by that party.  
    For purposes of this Article XVIII, damage or destruction caused by  
    public use of the Building, including the Building Common Areas, shall  
    be attributable to the City; provided that, Audubon shall have the  
    obligation to mitigate such damage to the extent possible.  
  
    D. No Obligation to Restore Personal Property.  
  
    If the City is required or elects to restore the Building or such  
    portion thereof which has been destroyed as provided in this  
    ArticleXVIII, the City shall not be required to restore Audubon's

    loss of the use of the whole or any part of the Premises, its tenant  
    improvements, alterations, modifications or additions made to the  
    Premises or Audubon's personal property, or any inconvenience or  
    annoyance occasioned by such damage, repair, reconstruction or  
    restoration, except as may be otherwise provided in Article XVIII A,  
    above.  
  
    E. Damage Near End of Term.  
  
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article  
    XVIII, the City shall not have any obligation whatsoever to repair,  
    reconstruct or restore the Premises (a) when the damage occurs during  
    the last twelve (12) months of the Term, (b) to the extent that  
    insurance proceeds are not available therefore, or (c) to the extent  
    the City is unable to obtain necessary permits for the construction  
    thereof.  
  
    XIX. CITY'S CONTROL OF BUILDING AND VICINITY  
  
    All common and other facilities provided by the City, except for the  
    Building Common Areas, including parking areas, are subject to the  
    exclusive control and management by the City.  Accordingly, the City  
    may do any and all of the following (among other activities in support  
    of DPR or other municipal objectives), without incurring any liability  
    whatsoever to Audubon; provided that, the City shall not act in a  
    manner that would unreasonably interfere or displace Audubon's  
    operations at Seward Park :  
  
    (i)  Change of Vicinity.   Increase, reduce, or change in any manner

    XX. DEFAULT; TERMINATION; REMEDIES

    The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a material  
    default and breach of this Use Agreement by Audubon:  
  
      (i)  Audubon's failure to pay Annual Rent or any other monetary sums  
    required to be paid hereunder within ten (10) days after notice;  
  
      (ii) Audubon's abandonment or vacation of the Premises for a period  
    of sixty (60) days unless such vacation has been required by the City  
    pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;  
  
      (iii) Audubon's failure to observe or perform any material covenant,  
    condition or provision of this Use Agreement not already specifically  
    mentioned in this Article XX, where such failure continues for thirty  
    (30) days after written notice thereof from the City to Audubon;  
    provided, however, that if the nature of the default is such that the  
    same cannot reasonably be cured within said thirty (30) day period,  
    Audubon shall not be deemed to be in default if Audubon shall within  
    such period commence such cure and thereafter diligently prosecute the  
    same to completion; or  
  
      (iv)  a material breach of the Development Agreement.  
  
    B. City Default.  
  
    The City's failure to observe or perform any material covenant,  
    condition or provision of this Use Agreement or the Development  
    Agreement, where such failure continues for thirty (30) days after  
    written notice thereof from Audubon to the City shall be a default;  
    provided, however, that if the nature of the default is such that the  
    same cannot reasonably be cured within said thirty (30) day period,  
    the City shall not be deemed to be in default if the City shall within  
    such period commence such cure and thereafter diligently prosecute the  
    same to completion.  
  
    C. Remedies.  
  
    If a default occurs, the party not in default may terminate this Use  
    Agreement, or any extension of it, by giving written notice thereof to  
    the party in default at least ninety (90) days prior to the effective  
    date of termination.  Upon the expiration of the date and time fixed  
    in the notice of termination, Audubon shall immediately surrender the  
    Premises and all improvements thereon, to the City.  
  
    D. Remedies Cumulative.  
  
    The remedies under this Article XX are in addition to, and not in  
    limitation of, any other remedies available to the City or Audubon in  
    law or equity.  
  
    XXI. TERMINATION  
  
    A. Termination for Bona Fide Public Purpose.  
  
    In addition to any other provision contained herein, the City may  
    terminate this Use Agreement at any time, in whole or in part, by  
    written notice, for a bona fide public purpose as determined by the  
    Seattle City Council; provided that, in such event, the City shall be  
    obligated to repay Audubon for the unamortized value of Audubon's  
    initial investment in the development and construction of the Building  
    or the portion thereof as to which this Use Agreement has been  
    terminated, pursuant to the Project Budget in Exhibit iii of the  
    Development Agreement, as depreciated, and less any amount previously  
    credited as an offset toward the Adjusted Fixed Rent.  
  
    B.  Voluntary Termination by Audubon.  In the event that Audubon is no  
    longer able to carry out the purposes of this Use Agreement because of  
    (a) corporate incapacity, (b) lack of funds to maintain and operate  
    the Building, (c) inability to obtain the necessary permits and  
    licenses from applicable governmental authorities, or (d) the  
    discovery of Hazardous Materials on the Premises that predate the  
    Commencement Date, , then Audubon shall have the right to terminate  
    this Lease upon one hundred twenty (120) days written notice to DPR.  
    If Audubon shall terminate this Lease as provided above, then Audubon  
    shall surrender the Premises pursuant to the City consistent with  
    Article XXIII (Surrender) hereof and shall not look to the City for  
    financial compensation except as may be provided by Article XIV. G.  
  
    XXII. SUBLEASES AND ASSIGNMENTS  
  
    Audubon shall not sublease, transfer, assign, mortgage, hypothecate or  
    convey this Use Agreement or any interest therein, in whole or in part  
    without the Superintendent's Approval, which Approval may be granted,  
    withheld, or conditioned in each instance in the Superintendent's sole  
    discretion.  This prohibition against transfers and assignments  
    includes any transfer or assignment by operation of law.  Any assignee  
    Approved by the Superintendent must accept and assume in writing all  
    the terms and conditions of this Use Agreement to be kept and  
    performed by Audubon.  Any transfer of this Use Agreement from Audubon  
    by merger, consolidation, transfer of assets, or liquidation shall  
    constitute an assignment for purposes of this Use Agreement.  The  
    Superintendent's consent to any assignment or transfer shall not  
    operate as a waiver of the necessity for consent to any subsequent  
    assignment or transfer, and the terms of such consent shall be binding  
    upon any person or entity using or occupying the Building or the  
    Premises by, under, or through Audubon.  
  
    XXIII. SURRENDER  
  
    A. Audubon's Obligations.  
  
    Subject to the terms of Article XVIII relating to damage and  
    destruction, upon expiration or earlier termination of the Term of  
    this Use Agreement whether by lapse of time or otherwise (including  
    any holdover period), Audubon, at its expense, shall: (a) deliver to  
    the City all keys to the Building, the Premises or any Personal  
    Property that the City has agreed may remain in or on the Premises or  
    accessory thereto; (b) except as otherwise agreed by the parties,  
    remove all of Audubon's moveable Personal Property, goods and effects  
    and those of all persons claiming under Audubon from the Premises; (c)  
    remove all telecommunications and computer network wiring and cabling,  
    to the extent required by the City, (d) remove all signs, symbols,  
    advertising and printed material, and (e) promptly and peacefully  
    surrender the Premises (including surrender of all Audubon  
    improvements and other attached equipment and/or other alterations,  
    additions or improvements installed in the Premises by the City or  
    Audubon) in reasonably clean condition together with all Approved  
    alterations, changes and additions thereto, in good repair, good order  
    and safe condition.  Any property left on the Premises more than  
    thirty (30) days after the expiration or termination of the Use  
    Agreement Term shall be deemed to have been abandoned and to have  
    become the property of the City to dispose of as the City deems  
    expedient and Audubon shall be liable for all costs associated with  
    the disposal of such property.  
  
    Audubon agrees to repair any damage to the Premises caused by or in  
    connection with the removal of any articles of personal property,  
    business or trade fixtures, signs or advertising, machinery,  
    equipment, furniture or movable partitions including, without  
    limitation thereto, repairing the floor and patching and painting the  
    walls where required by the City to the City's reasonable satisfaction  
    all at Audubon's sole cost and expense.  Audubon shall indemnify the  
    City against any loss or liability resulting from delay by Audubon in  
    so surrendering the Premises, including, without limitation, any  
    claims made by any tenant succeeding Audubon based on such delay.  
  
    B. Re-entry by City.  
  
    If the Premises are vacated or abandoned by Audubon, or in the event  
    of the termination of this Use Agreement under any provision hereof,  
    the City may re-enter the Premises in such manner as the City deems  
    necessary in its sole discretion, and the City may repossess the  
    Premises by force, summary proceedings or by any other procedure  
    provided by law or equity.  Audubon hereby waives all claims for  
    damages that may be caused by the City re-entering and taking  
    possession of the Premises or removing and storing Audubon's property  
    as herein provided, and Audubon shall indemnify and hold the City  
    harmless therefrom.  No such reentry shall be considered or construed  
    to be a forcible entry.  
  
    C. Survival of Liabilities.  
  
    Any liability of Audubon or the City hereunder for negligent or  
    intentional acts or omissions occurring during the Term of this Use  
    Agreement, or arising under the indemnity provisions of this Use  
    Agreement, shall survive termination and surrender (whether or not any  
    claim giving rise to such liability shall have accrued).  
  
    XXIV. QUIET ENJOYMENT  
  
    The City covenants that, subject to the express provisions of this Use  
    Agreement, if and so long as Audubon pays the Annual Rent and other  
    charges required by this Use Agreement, and performs all of its  
    obligations pursuant to the terms, covenants and conditions of this  
    Use Agreement, Audubon shall quietly enjoy the Premises.  
  
    XXV. DISPUTES  
  
    The parties shall make their best efforts to resolve disputes as  
    expeditiously as possible through negotiations between the Seward Park  
    Audubon Center Director and the DPR Director of Recreation and Support  
    Division.  If those negotiations are unsuccessful, the matter shall be  
    referred to the Senior Vice President of Audubon Centers and the DPR  
    Superintendent.  If the parties cannot resolve any dispute arising  
    under this Use Agreement, either party may submit the matter to a non-  
    binding, structured mediation procedure fashioned by persons or  
    organizations experienced in alternative dispute resolution ("ADR")  
    procedures. The mediation may be requested by any party and shall be  
    initiated within thirty (30) days from the date of the request unless  
    extended by agreement of both parties. The alternative dispute  
    resolution procedures utilized for the mediation shall include the  
    exchange of written claims and responses, with supporting information,  
    at least seven (7) days prior to the actual mediation. The positions  
    expressed and mediator's recommendations shall not be admissible as  
    evidence in any subsequent ADR or legal proceeding. If the matter is  
    submitted to mediation and the matter is not resolved, an affected  
    party shall be entitled to pursue any legal remedy available.  
  
    XXVI. CITY'S APPROVAL OR CONSENT  
  
    A. Consent Expressly for Use Agreement Purposes; Discretion of City.  
  
    Whenever the City's Approval is required under this Use Agreement (a)  
    Audubon must obtain such Approval expressly for purposes of this Use  
    Agreement, regardless of whether a consent or approval shall have been  
    granted by the City in its regulatory, public utility, or other  
    capacity; and (b) unless otherwise expressly stated herein, such  
    Approval may be withheld in the City's reasonable discretion.  
  
    B. Consents Hereunder Not for Regulatory Purposes.  
  
    Any permission, consent, or Approval of the City contained herein or  
    given pursuant to this Use Agreement is or shall be granted solely in  
    the City's capacity of lessor of the Premises, and not in its  
    regulatory or public utility capacity. No such consent or Approval  
    shall be construed as any representation or assurance that the matter  
    consented to or Approved complies with applicable laws, regulations,  
    ordinances or Codes, nor shall any such consent or Approval be  
    construed to authorize any failure to comply with any of the  
    foregoing.  
  
    XXVII. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS  
  
    The terms, covenants and conditions contained in the Use Agreement and  
    in the Exhibits annexed thereto shall bind Audubon and its successors,

    XXXIII. AUDITS AND RECORDS  
  
    A. Program Audit Report.  
  
    Audubon will furnish to City a written program audit report, performed  
    by Audubon staff.  If so required by the City after any breach or  
    default by Audubon hereunder (whether or not such breach or default  
    shall have been cured), the program audit shall be performed by a  
    qualified independent consultant. The program audits will be provided  
    to the City annually, within 30 days after the end of each calendar  
    year, unless otherwise Approved by the City.  If any annual audit  
    report indicates noncompliance with the provisions of this Use  
    Agreement or if the Superintendent reasonably believes that problems  
    exist, the City may, by written notice to Audubon, require that  
    semiannual audit reports be provided.  Program audits shall include  
    but not be limited to:  compliance with contract terms; maintenance of  
    records; program delivery; property maintenance; liaison with  
    community and outreach efforts, program fees; value of fee discounts  
    and scholarships, finances; and any other topic agreed between the

    a DPR representative within sixty (60) days of submission of the  
    annual Audit report for the purpose of evaluating Audubon's  
    programmatic performance under this Agreement.  To the extent  
    practicable, Audubon shall incorporate all reasonable suggestions made  
    by the DPR representative into its programs.  
  
    B. Records.  
  
    In addition to the foregoing, the City shall have the right, at the  
    City's cost and expense, to perform, or to commission a consultant to  
    perform, audits or reviews of Audubon's activities at Seward Park at  
    any time.  Audubon shall prepare and maintain in good order, accurate  
    and up-to-date records demonstrating compliance with the terms of this  
    Use Agreement and documenting the operation of the Premises, and shall  
    make all such records available for inspection and copying promptly  
    upon the City's request; provided, that, Audubon reserves the right to  
    redact information related to private fundraising activities and  
    private donor information.  The provisions of this Article and the  
    rights of the City hereunder shall be included in any Approved  
    sublease.

    or other agent of the City shall be personally liable to Audubon, its  
    successors and assigns, in the event of any default or breach by the  
    City or for any amount which may become due to Audubon, its successors  
    and assigns under this Use Agreement, or for any obligation of the  
    City under this Use Agreement.  Likewise, no board member, member,  
    officer, employee or other agent of Audubon shall be personally liable

    may become due to the City, its successors and assigns, or for any

           General Liability and Business Automobile Liability Insurance).

    without limitation inflation or changes in the nature or scope of  
    activities on the Premises, then Audubon shall procure such increases  
    in policy limits as the City shall require, within sixty (60) days of

    DPR KEY CONTROL POLICY  
  
    Department Policy & Procedure  
    City of Seattle  
  
    Subject:  Key Control  
    Number  060-P 2.7.1  
    Effective  July 1, 1999  
    Supersedes  September 20, 1993  
  
    Approved:  
    Department:  Parks and Recreation  
  
    1.0  PURPOSE  
  
    1.0 To provide for the security of Department employees, facilities  
    and equipment by managing the Key and Lock Control System.  
  
    2.0  ORGANIZATIONS AFFECTED  
      2.1  Department of Parks and Recreation  
      2.2  Seattle School District  
  
    3.0  REFERENCES   None  
  
    4.0  POLICY  
  
      4.1  The Security Program Specialist, in coordination with the FMDD  
    Customer Support Manager, Customer Support Administrative Staff and  
    Carpenter Shop personnel shall manage the key and lock control system.  
    Facility staff shall be managed by facility managers and the Security  
    Program Specialist shall manage the policy to protect the integrity of  
    the Park Department Key and Lock Control System.  
  
      4.2  Keys to Department-owned or operated facilities are issued to  
    Department employees as needed in their jobs.  
  
      4.3  First line supervisors are responsible for all keys issued to  
    their employees.  
  
      4.4  Key holders are responsible for the keys issued to them and are  
    forbidden to loan or give their Department-issued keys to anyone else.  
  
      4.5  Outside duplication of Department keys is not allowed.  
  
      4.6  Non-employees are issued operational key(s) only with the  
    express permission of the appropriate program facility manager, and  
    their Section Manager.  The Security Program Specialist retains the  
    right to review each request for appropriateness.  
  
        4.6.1  Non-employees will be required to make a cash deposit  
    before being issued keys, except as in paragraph 7.3.4  
  
        4.6.2 Non-employees will normally not be reissued keys after  
    having lost keys.  
  
        4.6.3  Associated Recreation Council (ARC), Woodland Park  
    Zoological Society and Aquarium Society employees will be treated the  
    same as Department employees when issuing keys and for other  
    provisions of this policy and procedure.  
  
      4.7  A responsible individual will sign for each key issued.  A  
    supervisor (or designee) may sign as the recipient for line staff.  
    Certain keys, such as for toilet paper holders, towel dispensers, etc.  
    will not be part of Key Control.  
  
      4.8  Because of the value of the stock of certain non-Department  
    tenants of Department facilities, such tenants will use their own lock  
    cores and issue their own keys (e.g., Seattle Art Museum, Museum of  
    History and Industry, Golf Pro Shops) except for roadway gates and  
    bollards which require Police, Fire, and Parks Department access.  
    Concessionaires will supply locks and keys in accordance with the  
    conditions of their contracts with the Department.  
  
      4.9  Supervisors may not permanently retain, reissue or otherwise  
    change assignment of employees' keys except through the Key Control  
    Policy.  Any transfer of keys from one individual to another will not  
    be done within the organization unit but will be accomplished by  
    turning the keys in to the Key Control Office.  
  
      4.10 Locks will not be changed or re-cored without the written  
    Approval of the Security Program Specialist.  
  
        4.10.1  Program facility managers will submit re-coring requests in  
    writing to the Security Program Specialist, clearly stating the  
    reason(s) for the request.  
  
        4.10.2  The Security Program Specialist will evaluate the recoring  
    request.  A key audit is required unless waived by Security.  
  
        4.10.3  If the recoring request is Approved, a job order will be  
    called into the Consolidated Work Order System (CWOS) for the  
    Carpenter Shop, (who shall be responsible for keying of cores and  
    changing the cores in buildings.  They will decide which cores are  
    appropriate for a given need and then submit a recoring plan to the  
    Security Program Specialist for Approval).  
  
        4.10.4  The Carpenter Shop will not change key cores or issue keys  
    without an Approved work order except in an emergency with the  
    Approval of the Security Program Specialist or Parks Duty Officer, as  
    appropriate.  
  
        4.10.5  Written notification of recoring shall be done by the Security  
    Program Specialist and new keys will be provided by the Key Control  
    Office.  
  
        4.10.6  Zoo management will be able to recore without obtaining prior  
    permission, but Zoo staff will send a record of permanent  
    recoring of facilities to the Security Program Specialist (who will  
    forward it to the CWOS Administrative Specialists for entry into the  
    Key control Data Base).  
  
      4.11  Forced entry (entry without the proper key) may be authorized  
    only in emergencies and in consultation of the Security Program  
    Specialist or Park Duty Officer, as appropriate.  (See paragraph 7.6)  
  
    5.0  DEFINITIONS  
  
      5.1  The Key and Lock Control System is defined as the keys and door  
    cores that secure buildings and equipment.  Vehicle, desk, cash  
    register, toilet paper holders, paper towel dispensers, and other  
    minor work-related keys are not within the scope of this system and  
    their issuance, use and disposition are exempt from the provisions of  
    the Key Control Policy.  
  
      5.2  As delegated by the Customer Support Manager, a trained  
    member(s) of the Facilities Maintenance Customer Support/Jobline staff  
    shall be designated Key Control Officer and assigned the duties of  
    issuing keys and keeping key and lock related records.  The Key  
    Control Office shall maintain Sonitrol records, issue and delete  
    Sonitrol numbers, and maintain the Parks Duty Officer (PDO) schedule  
    and perform other related duties as assigned.  The Customer Support  
    Manager shall assign members of the Customer Support Services staff to  
    backfill and "cover" the Key Control Officer position as appropriate.  
  
    6.0  RESPONSIBILITY  
  
      6.1  First Line Supervisors - It shall be the responsibility of  
    first line supervisors to identify the key needs of their personnel,  
    to requisition appropriate keys promptly for those personnel, to  
    instruct the employees in proper key safeguard methods during  
    orientation and to ensure the prompt return of keys by individuals  
    leaving the Department.  Each supervisor signing Separation Report  
    Forms must ensure the keys have been turned in to the Key Control  
    Office BEFORE he or she signs and processes the form.  
  
        6.1.1  A responsible supervisor may sign as the recipient for the  
    employee (e.g. John Doe, supervisor for Jane Smith).  
  
        6.1.2  Each supervisor shall instruct his/her subordinates in key  
    control procedures during new employee orientation and thereafter  
    annually.  
  
        6.1.3  As a regular part of the annual employee evaluation  
    process, it is recommended that the supervisor perform, a key audit.  
    This consists of writing out a list of keys carried by the employee.  
    Return this list and any keys no longer needed to the Key Control  
    Office.  Each supervisor may also audit keys of employees as  
    needed, or as requested by the Security Program Specialist.  
  
        6.1.4  Each supervisor shall promptly report all losses of  
    keys by persons in his/her organization.  The supervisors shall make a  
    phone report to the Security Program Specialist within the first three  
    hours of the next working day, and written follow-up reports to the  
    Division Director, with copies to the Security Program Specialist and  
    Key Control Office, within a week.  
  
        6.1.5  Each supervisor is responsible for the key security  
    performance of his/her employees.  
  
        6.1.6  Persons returning keys shall verify that keys have been  
    signed off/on the key control signature card each time keys are  
    returned to the Key Control Office.  An employee is responsible for  
    his or her keys until they are returned and signed off.  
  
        6.1.7  It is the responsibility of the first line supervisor to  
    return keys when they are no longer needed.  If an employee transfers  
    to a different work unit, the outgoing supervisor is responsible for  
    collecting and returning the employee's keys.  The new supervisor is  
    responsible for obtaining and issuing the appropriate keys to the  
    transferred employee.  
  
          6.1.7.1  Punitive action may be taken if 6.1.7 is not  
    complied with (see 7.5).  
  
      6.2  Security Program Specialist - The Security Program Specialist  
    shall (via appropriate staff):  
  
        6.2.1  Maintain key assignment cards for all individuals holding  
    Department and joint use public school keys, and shall require a  
    signature for each key issued.  Upon return of each key, the Key  
    Control Office shall sign and write "returned" on the card.  
  
        6.2.2  Maintain a cross file for each key designation, listing  
    persons having corresponding keys.  
  
        6.2.3  Maintain an up-to-date file of lost keys and of the names  
    of individuals and the organizations which they represent who have  
    been careless with keys or have lost keys.  
  
        6.2.4  Maintain a list of door core assignments.  
  
        6.2.5  Issue only authorized keys that are the lowest security  
     key required to do the job.  
  
        6.2.6  Maintain a date "tickler" file indicating when temporary  
    key issues are due to be returned.  
  
        6.2.7  Ask for key audits on occasion, with or without specific  
    cause.  
  
        6.2.8  Issue keys only with appropriate authorization, except in  
    emergencies and security related matters.  
  
      6.3  Human Resources Unit - The Human Resources Unit shall advise  
    the Key Control Office when personnel are being separated from  
    employment.  
  
      6.4  The Security Program Specialist is responsible for insuring the  
    integrity of the key and lock policy.  He or she also has the  
    authority to coordinate with all Parks Department employees and  
    vendors as necessary to implement this policy.  The Security Program  
    Specialist shall be the administrator of the key and lock policy, with  
    the understanding that normal operational functions shall be under the  
    direct supervision of the appropriate manager or crew lead.  
  
      6.5  Initiators of a Key Request for non-Department persons - A  
    "sponsor" recommending that a key be issued to a non-Parks person  
    shall be responsible for seeing that the issued key is returned  
    promptly at the date the Use Agreement is up, the contract is  
    completed, the sport season is over, or the special event is finished  
    and clean-up is completed.  Such a sponsor will normally be the person  
    with the Department function most closely related to the reason for  
    the key issue (e.g., Project Manager sponsors contractor; Grants and  
    Contracts Manager sponsors concessionaire; Community Center  
    Coordinator sponsors Day Care Center programs).  
  
    7.0  PROCEDURE  
  
      7.1  Issuing Keys to Employees  
  
        7.1.1  Initiation of request - Employee's supervisor initiates a  
    request for the employee on a Key Requisition Form.  
  
        7.1.2  Approval routing - The employee sends the request  
    through his or her supervisor and Section Manager, for Approval.  
  
        7.1.3  The Section Manager sends the request to the Key Control  
    Office for processing.  Key control Officer will only forward 'master'  
    key requests and any problematic requests to the Security Program  
    Specialist for review and Approval.  
  
          7.1.3.1  The requestor shall be notified when the keys are ready  
    to be picked up.  If the key requests are hand-carried, it will be up  
    to the discretion of the Key Control Office when the key can be  
    issued.  The Key Control Office shall make every effort to issue  
    keys in a timely manner.  
  
        7.1.4  The Section Manager can Approve keys within his or  
    her area of supervision.  A Director and the Security Program  
    Specialist needs to Approve the Key Request only if the employee has  
    lost keys, a discipline issue is involved, a grand master is being  
    requested, a key is being issued to a non-employee, or is complicated  
    by other factors.  
  
        7.1.5  The Section Manager can limit employees access to  
    facilities under his or her direct supervision.  
  
        7.1.6  Key assignment cards- The Key Control Office issues the  
    Approved key(s) in exchange for a signature for each key (one key -  
    one signature).  A name card thereby keeps listings of keys held by  
    each person.  There shall be a dual record keeping system, (i.e. key  
    assignment cards and a key control database) until paper key  
    assignment cards are replaced by electronic key assignment database.  
    Then a written addendum shall explain the changes in the policy.  
  
      7.2  Issuing Keys to Contractors  
  
        7.2.1  General - for minor jobs, it is permissible to issue  
    a specific key to the contractor upon Approval of the Project Manager  
    and Supervisor.  The Project Manager will initiate the key requisition  
    and route for Approval via the procedure outlined above in 7.1.2.  
  
        7.2.2  Major construction - In case of new construction or major  
    building overhaul, the Project Development Section will specify vendor  
    installation of a "contractor's core" and vendor return to the proper  
    Department core, at the contractor's expense.  
  
      7.3  Issuing Keys to Non-Employees  - Keys are sometimes  
    issued to non-employees when the public benefits significantly from  
    keys being issued to particular individuals.  These cases are often  
    associated with children's or other programs operated by a non-profit  
    organization, or by a concession operation on a city-owned facility  
    (Pratt Fine Arts is an example).  In justified cases, keys are issued  
    in the following manner:  
  
        7.3.1  Initiation of request - The program organization with  
    operational responsibility for the service, or for the facility  
    involved, initiates the request on a Key Requisition Form (B-65).  The  
    initiator notes on the form the need or benefits involved and  
    recommends Approval.  (See Responsibility section 6.5.)  
  
        7.3.2  See 7.1.3  
  
        7.3.3  A key deposit of $50 is required for all non-Department  
    persons, for each key.  
  
          7.3.3.1  The appropriate Division Director may waive or reduce  
    the fifty dollar deposit per key only in exceptional cases:  
  
            -  the key user is under contract to the Department relative  
    to the service that necessitates the key.  
  
            -  the key user is doing the Department a service in providing  
    the assistance that necessitates the key.  
  
            -  A contractor will normally pay the key deposit.  
  
          7.3.3.2  The Department encourages key deposits in the form of  
    checks to the "Parks and Recreation Department" rather than cash, but  
    in either case the Key Control officers or appropriate management  
    staff, via chain of supervision, shall issue receipts for the key  
    deposits. A due date will be determined at the time of issue.  The  
    deposits are forwarded to the Accounting and Payroll Unit (with names,  
    organizations, addresses, and phone numbers) for placement in a  
    guaranteed deposit fund.  
  
        7.3.4 Keys will not be issued to private citizens to restrict the use  
    of or to secure public property.  The securing of Parks facilities is  
    the exclusive responsibility of Department employees, Police and Fire  
    Department staff, and specifically hired security personnel.  The  
    Department, not being in direct control of the circumstances under  
    which a private citizen may use a key, would set up conditions for  
    misuse and could be negligent and possibly liable.  
  
        7.3.5 Key and deposit returns - Upon return of each key from a non-  
    employee, the Key Control Office will take the following actions  
    :  
  
          7.3.5.1  Sign an appropriate entry(s) on the signature card.  
  
          7.3.5.2 A return receipt will be given, if requested  
  
          7.3.5.3  Notify the Accounting Unit that the key(s) has been  
    returned and that the deposit is to be refunded.  
  
      7.4  Safeguarding Keys and Restrictive Considerations  
  
        7.4.1  Persons having keys are to take conscientious care in the  
    safeguarding of those keys.  Keys will normally be kept on the person  
    or in locked cabinets - not in desks, vehicles, or other unsecured  
    places.  
  
        7.4.2  Keys are not to be loaned between co-workers except in  
    emergencies, and then not for more than 24 hours.  Such loans are only  
    to be made with a specific Approval of line supervisors, within their  
    line responsibility, and upon notification of the Security Program  
    Specialist.  If keys are loaned between co-workers, a receipt will be  
    issued to the employee giving up his or her keys.  
  
        7.4.3  Keys to the exterior doors of Parks buildings will be   
    provided only to persons working there and who arrive early,  
    leave late, or work weekends.  
  
        7.4.4  Each supervisor will promptly notify the  
    Security Program Specialist in writing of all key procedure violations  
    and lost keys for review by management to determine corrective  
    measures needed, such as recoring locks, changing procedures, and  
    charging for costs incurred.  The notification will clearly state the  
    circumstances surrounding the loss of the keys (date, time,  
    approximate location) and whether or not the loss poses a security  
    problem.  
  
        7.4.5  Employees going on leave-of-absence, or "zero" timesheets,  
    or extended sick leave MUST return all keys to the Key Control Office.  
    Keys then will be tagged and locked in the key control file for  
    safekeeping.  
  
        7.4.6  Any employee may return any keys to the (Key Control  
    Office) for safekeeping while on vacation.  Losing keys in activities  
    like skiing or while on vacation will be considered evidence of direct  
    violation of these instructions.  
  
        7.4.7  Day Care Center employees, SPICE Program employees, and  
    other non-Parks personnel may not pass keys to each other, and  
    instruction and enforcement is a responsibility of appropriate Parks  
    employees with assignments related to the non-Parks function (see  
    7.3).  
  
      7.5  Disciplinary and Corrective Measures  
  
        7.5.1  Violations of the provision of this policy and procedure by  
    Department employees will be handled in accordance with the Policy and  
    Procedure on "Coaching and Corrective Action" (060- P 4.4.3).  
  
          7.5.1.1  The supervisor or (manager) who can recommend  
    appropriate coaching or corrective action will review key procedure  
    violations.  
  
          7.5.1.2  The supervisor or manager will consider the  
    following factors when evaluating a key procedure violation.  
  
              -  The extent of employee carelessness  
              -  Where and when a key was lost  
              -  The level of security affected  
              -  Whether an employee took sufficient care to safeguard the  
                 key(s)  
              -  Whether the violation is a second offense  
              -  The loss of a "grandmaster" or other "master" key (those  
                 keys which open more than one facility) will be considered  
                 to be a more serious infraction than the loss of other keys.  
  
          7.5.1.3  The supervisor or manager must check with the Security  
    Program Specialist to determine the potential effect on the security  
    of the employee's facilities or equipment from the key policy  
    violation.  
  
          7.5.1.4  The Security Program Specialist will notify the  
    appropriate Division Director of certain key policy violations:  
  
              -  The second loss of keys within one year  
              -  Extreme carelessness in safeguarding keys  
              -  Apparent uncorrected key policy violations  
              -  Duplication of Department keys  
  
          7.5.1.5  The loss of a "grandmaster" or other "master" key,  
    (those keys that open more than one facility) will be considered to be  
    a more serious infraction of the Policy and Procedure and may be  
    treated as such when discipline is given.  The loss of a "master" key  
    may result in suspension, demotion or dismissal depending upon the  
    severity of the loss of security.  Security cores J sand K series  
    shall be included and considered "masters".  
  
        7.5.2  Any non-employee who loses a key(s) will lose his or her  
    key deposit and will also be billed for any necessary or desirable  
    recoring if there is any indication of not having taken conscientious  
    care of the key(s).  
  
      7.6  Forced Entry without a Key  
  
        7.6.1  When time permits, a person may force entry only after  
    telephoning and coordinating with the Security Program Specialist  
    during working hours, or with the Parks Duty Officer during off-hours.  
  
        7.6.2  When time does not permit this coordination, any   
    person cutting a lock or otherwise forcing entry must report  
    by telephone to the Security Program Specialist or Parks Duty Officer  
    immediately thereafter, and follow-up in 24 hours with a written  
    report to the Security Program Specialist via line management.  The  
    report must clearly state the necessity, the Approving authority, the  
    persons involved, and the resecuring action taken.
