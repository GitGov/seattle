    adjust future invoices or require immediate repayment of reimbursed

    contract, or been reimbursed in error.  
  
    * Termination of the Contract:  The WDC may decide to terminate the  
    contract in whole, or in part.

    City of Seattle, Department of IT  
  
    February 19, 2003 through December 16, 2004  
  
    I. PROGRAM OVERVIEW  
  
    This Department of Labor Technical Training grant will provide the  
    City of Seattle advance technology training to incumbent IT workers.  
    The H-1B grant funds will give the City an opportunity to focus our  
    training needs to address strategic skill shortages and reduce  
    dependence on contract labor.  Furthermore, an objective of this grant  
    is wage progression for employees who both acquire new skills through  
    training and demonstrate application of those skills as they work on  
    more demanding assignments.  
  
    II. PROGRAM DESIGN DESCRIPTION  
  
    The following steps are intended to give the WDC a visual of the  
    City's program design including which City person, position or  
    organization has responsibilities:  
  
    Step 1.  Departmental Alignment  
  
      Who: Department IT managers and employees  
  
    Managers/supervisors and employees will review written departmental or  
    work group goals and objectives as well as Citywide IT strategic  
    directions.  Training needs will be identified and will be based on  
    departmental or work group goals, strategic plans and planned  
    projects, including maintenance upgrades. Alignment between Citywide  
    and departmental business objectives, supporting IT skills and  
    strategic training needs will be re-confirmed annually.  
  
    Step 2.  Re-confirm Skill Needs  
  
      Who: H-1B Steering Committee1 which is made up of members from the  
    Joint Union Management Information Technology Training Committee and  
    the Human Resources-Information Technology Committee  
  
      Key skill areas were identified as part of the H-1B grant proposal.  
    Based on the departmental alignment review, the H-1B Steering  
    Committee will confirm these areas as skill needs through the City of  
    Seattle's IT governance structure.  In addition, the Steering  
    Committee will develop the success criteria as well as the criteria  
    for the participant selection process and determine the best way to  
    meet grant reporting requirements.  This information will be  
    communicated to the City departments participating in the grant.  
  
    Step 3. Participant Selection Process  
  
    Who: Department IT managers, employees and City of Seattle (CoS) IT  
    Coach/CoS Local 17 Coaches  
  
    * Manager and employee meet to identify if the employee is an eligible  
    candidate for H-1B training funds.  Eligibility requirements will  
    reflect the Department of Labor guidelines, including marketing this  
    program to under-represented populations such as women and minorities.  
  
    * Managers and employees will meet to discuss training opportunities.  
  
    * The eligible candidate will, with the help of the manager and CoS IT  
    Coach/CoS Local 17 Coaches, use an assessment tool to help predict  
    whether or not the candidate is likely to complete training.  
  
    * Employee completes the H-1B application form.  
  
    * Manager signs the H-1B application form and sends it to the IT  
    Coach/Grant Manager.  
  
    * The IT Coach/Grant Manager evaluates the application against the  
    Steering Committee's success criteria.  Applications meeting selection  
    criteria are approved and those not meeting the criteria are referred  
    back to the Steering Committee for resolution.  
  
    * The CoS Local 17 IT Coaches will provide additional mentoring and  
    career guidance to Local 17 members.  
  
    Step 4 . Training  
  
    Who: IT Coach/Grant Manager, IT Managers, Departmental Training  
    Coordinators, H-1B partner organizations and training participants  
  
    * The IT Coach/Grant Manager communicates the City's training needs to  
    all training providers within our purchasing system to obtain the  
    universe of training sources that can fill our needs.  The City  
    obtains pricing tiers and options from training providers.  
  
    * To try to leverage economies of scale, the IT Coach/Grant Manager  
    communicates the training opportunities to all appropriate City  
    employees, IT managers, Departmental IT Training Coordinators, as well  
    as all grant partners.  
  
    * The IT Coach/Grant Manager books the class.  
  
    * Individuals go to training:  
  
    o Training is planned to be during normal working hours  
  
    o Transportation will be provided as part of normal City business  
    systems  
  
    * The IT Coach will check in with students at least once during the  
    course of their training to make sure they are succeeding.  
  
    * Departmental training administrators enter training information into  
    the City's human resources information system (HRIS).  
  
    Step 5. Using the Skills  
  
    Who: Departmental IT Managers and employees  
  
    * As job assignments2 become available, managers will, whenever  
    possible, use employees who have recently received training through  
    this grant.  Managers will endeavor to pair recently trained employees  
    with more experienced people who can "mentor" them in their new  
    duties.  
  
    * Employee uses new skills to perform job assignment and sees wage  
    progression3.  
  
    Step 6. Administration  
  
    Who: H-1B IT Coach/Grant Manager working with City departments  
  
    * The training provider bills DoIT.  
  
    * The H-1B IT Coach/Grant Manager submits invoices (including ones for  
    administrative costs) to WDC for reimbursement and the WDC will remit  
    payment per the attached schedule of payments provided by the WDC.  
  
    * The H-1B IT Coach/Grant Manager will bill and receive payments from  
    departments.  
  
    * DoIT pays training provider.  
  
    Step 7. Reporting  
  
    Who: IT Coach/Grant Manager and department IT managers, H-1B Steering  
    Committee  
  
    All pertinent data elements, including financial information and  
    accounting for matching funds, will be collected on an ongoing basis  
    by the IT Coach/Grant Manager.  
  
    The following data elements will be submitted to the WDC for this  
    Employer Service Contract in a format and through a schedule that will  
    be mutually agreed upon:  
  
    * Wage progression information is extracted from the City's HRIS  
    system  
  
    * IT Managers provide information on reliance on contractors  
  
    * IT Managers report on the ability of trainees to step into tasks  
    which require the use of advanced technical skills in the target areas  
  
    III. PROJECTED OUTCOMES, OUTPUTS, TIMELINE & ACTIVITIES  
  
    IFPTE Local 17/City of Seattle will enroll a minimum of 150 incumbent  
    workers in training across the following ten IT occupation tracks:  
  
    1.  
  
    1. Programming/Software Engineering  
  
    2. Database Development/Administration  
  
    3. Network Design and Administration  
  
    4. Enterprise Systems Analysis/Integration  
  
    5. Technical Support  
  
    6. Web Development/Administration  
  
    7. Digital Media  
  
    8. Quality Assurance/QA Testing  
  
    9. IT Project Management  
  
    10. Information Security  
  
    $715,067 is the total DoL matching funds available for training.  
    Based on the above minimum number of training participants, the  
    average per student training dollars available is $4,767.11.   These  
    grant dollars will cover tuition, books and supplies.  The per  
    employee allocations will be capped at $6,000 ($9,000 including the  
    match).  
  
    The City will commit to a minimum of $472,222 of match.  
  
    The City projects that there will be a minimum aggregate of 2% wage  
    progression for those IT incumbent employees who successfully acquire  
    new skills through training and demonstrate application of those  
    skills as they work on more demanding assignments per the City's IT  
    Professional compensation process.  The wage progression will be in  
    excess of inflation, cost of living adjustments or general market  
    adjustments.  
  
    The H-1B Steering Committee will evaluate the grant outcomes after six  
    months to determine if this process is effective.  
  
    The City can count as match any training that has occurred on or after  
    February 19, 2003, provided that it falls under the ten key skill  
    areas that were identified as part of the H-1B grant proposal.  
    Furthermore, the WDC will reimburse the City for the hours that the IT  
    Coach/Grant Administrator has worked on or after February 19, 2003.  
  
    1 The Steering Committee has two Co-Chairs, one from labor and one  
    from management.  
  
    2 Job assignments are tied to business needs.  
  
    3 The City of Seattle's compensation system is designed to recognize  
    and reward, through salary increases, employees' acquisition of new  
    skills through training and the employee's demonstrated application of  
    those skills as they work on more demanding assignments.  There will  
    be some time lag between the completion of training provided and  
    increased compensation for employees as they need to apply their  
    skills in the workplace before salary adjustments are made.  Pay  
    increases are subject to the City's budget process and personnel  
    systems.

    certification from the bond-issuing agency.  
  
    F.  CANCELLATION OF AWARD  
  
  
  
    The WDC reserves the right to cancel an award immediately if new State  
    or Federal regulations or policy makes it necessary to change the  
    program purpose or content substantially, or to prohibit such a  
    program.  
  
    G.  CHANGES AND MODIFICATIONS  
  
    The WDC may initiate changes in the services to be performed, or  
    in the project undertaken, when such changes are necessitated by  
    actions of the Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department  
    of Labor (DOL), as empowered by the Act or Federal Regulations  
    promulgated thereunder.  Such changes, including any increase or  
    decrease in the amount of reimbursement, shall be incorporated as a  
    written modification to the Contract.  
  
    The WDC reserves the right to unilaterally modify the contract as a  
    result of Federal or State imposed requirements.  In these cases, the  
    WDC will notify the Contractor in writing.  Upon receipt of such  
    notification, and within 5 working days, the Contractor shall have the  
    option of agreeing to such amendment or notifying the WDC it cannot  
    comply and terminate the contract, as specified in Section GG-  
    Termination.  
  
    The WDC reserves the right to modify this contract in whole or in part  
    within ten (10) calendar days written notice in the event expected or  
    actual funding is withdrawn, reduced or limited in any way after the  
    effective date of this contract and prior to normal completion  
    thereof.  The WDC agrees to pay the Contractor for all work performed  
    prior to the effective date of modification, provided that such  
    services performed are in accordance with the provisions of this  
    contract.  
  
    H.  CHOICE OF LAW  
  
    This contract shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with  
    the laws of the State of Washington and the venue of any action  
    brought hereunder shall be in King County.  
  
    I.  COMPLAINT AND HEARING PROCEDURE  
  
    The Contractor shall abide by an applicable Complaint and Hearing  
    Procedure.  If enrollment of participants is part of this contract,  
    the Contractor agrees to implement and maintain a Complaint and  
    Hearing Procedure.  All participants shall be informed, in writing, of  
    the Complaint and Hearing Procedure and that it is available for their  
    review.  
  
    J.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST/CODE OF CONDUCT  
  
    Every reasonable course of action will be taken by the Contractor in  
    order to maintain the integrity of this expenditure of public funds  
    and to avoid any favoritism or questionable or improper conduct.  This  
    contract will be administered in an impartial manner, free from  
    personal, financial, or political gain.  The Contractor, its executive  
    staff and employees, in administering this Contract, shall avoid  
    situations that give rise to a suggestion that any decision was  
    influenced by prejudice, bias, special interest, or personal gain.  
  
    Gratuities in the form of entertainment, gifts or otherwise offered by  
    the Contractor, or an agent or representative of the Contractor to any  
    officer or employee of the Grantor or WDC, with a view toward securing  
    this Contract or securing favorable treatment with respect to the  
    awarding or amending or the making of any determination will render  
    this Contract voidable at the option of the WDC and may justify  
    further action under RCW 42.52.  
  
    Contractor shall have a written Code of Conduct for procurement,  
    award, and administration of contracts.  The Code of Conduct regarding  
    the conflict of interest shall contain penalties, sanctions or other  
    disciplinary actions.  The Code of Conduct shall apply to Contractor  
    staff.  The Code of Conduct shall ensure that no one in a decision-  
    making capacity shall have a real or apparent conflict of interest in  
    the selection, award, or administration of contracts or subcontracts.  
    A conflict of interest arises when any of the following have a  
    financial interest or other interest in the firm or organization  
    selected for award:  
  
        a.  Individual,  
  
      b.  Member of the immediate family,  
  
        c.  Employing organization, or  
  
        d.  Future employing organization.  
  
    The officers, employees, or agents of the Contractor making the award  
    will neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of  
    monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to  
    sub-agreements.  Contractor may set minimum rules where the financial  
    interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of  
    nominal intrinsic value.  
  
    A Contractor cannot be involved with decision making if there is a  
    direct financial benefit.  However, Workforce Development Council  
    membership or receipt of funds to provide training and related  
    services do not violate WIA Section 111(f) and Section 117(g).  
  
    K.  CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION  
  
    The Contractor agrees to complete registration with the Department of  
    Revenue, Department of Labor and Industries and Employment Security  
    Tax Administration by having filed a master business application prior  
    to the execution of this Contract and to pay any taxes, fees or  
    deposits required by the state as a condition of providing services  
    under this Contract.  Contractor will provide the WDC with its  
    Washington Unified Business Identifier (UBI) number or its Washington  
    Industries account number and its Unemployment Insurance tax number,  
    if registration with these agencies occurred prior to January 2, 1987,  
    if requested by the WDC.  The required information will be provided  
    prior to the Contractor commencing services under this Contract.  
  
    L.  CORRECTIVE ACTION POLICY AND PROCEDURE  
  
    In the event the WDC determines that a breach of contract, including  
    but not limited to the lack of acceptable performance or suspected  
    fraud, abuse, or other criminal activity has occurred in the  
    Contractor's compliance with the conditions of this contract, and the  
    situation is deemed by the WDC to merit corrective action, the  
    following sequential procedure will be implemented:  
  
    1. The WDC will notify the Contractor formally in writing of the  
    perceived breach of contract and/or the Contractor's lack of  
    acceptable performance;  
  
    2. The Contractor will respond to the WDC's concerns by providing in  
    writing a proposed plan of corrective action including proposed  
    completion date for bringing the contract into compliance.  Such  
    response must be received by the WDC within ten (10) working days of  
    the date of the Contractor's receipt of the WDC's formal notification;  
  
    3. The WDC will notify the Contractor in writing as to the final  
    disposition of the WDC's concerns.  The determination of the  
    sufficiency of the Contractor's corrective action plan and  
    implementation schedule shall be at the sole discretion of the WDC;  
  
    4. If the Contractor does not respond within the appropriate time with  
    a corrective action plan, or fails to implement the plan to the  
    satisfaction of the WDC, the WDC reserves the option of serving a  
    reduction or termination notice on the Contractor that will become  
    effective twenty (20) working days after receipt.  The WDC shall be  
    liable for payment only for services rendered prior to the effective  
    date of the notice provided that such services performed are in  
    accordance with the terms and provisions of this contract.  
  
    If necessary, the WDC reserves the right to suspend, in whole or in  
    part, the contract, and to withhold further payments, or to prohibit  
    the Contractor from incurring additional obligations of funds during  
    investigation of the alleged breach and pending corrective action.  
  
    M.  DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION  
  
    The WDC shall not contract with individuals or organizations which are  
    debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible from  
    participation in Federal Assistance Programs under Executive Order  
    12549, "Debarment and Suspension, codified at 29 CFR part 98.  
  
    N.  DISPUTE/APPEAL  
  
    The Contractor must file with the WDC in writing within 15 calendar  
    days of when the Contractor believes the complaint (act, event,  
    default) in question occurred.  This notice must clearly state the  
    reason for the complaint, the law, regulation or contract provision  
    that has been violated and the remedy sought.  The WDC will, based on  
    all factors, render a decision upon the matter.  If the Contractor  
    disagrees with the resolution reached, they have 15 calendar days from  
    the date of the WDC's written decision to submit a request for further  
    appeal.  This request, clearly stating the reason for the appeal, the  
    law, regulation or contract provision that has been violated and the  
    remedy sought, shall then be taken before an Administrative Law Judge  
    through the Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings for  
    arbitration in Seattle, Washington.  The arbitrator's findings,  
    decisions, and awards shall be final, binding and conclusive on both  
    the parties hereto and judgment hereto may be entered in any court or  
    forum having jurisdiction.  All costs shall be borne equally by both  
    parties, with the exception that each party is responsible for its own  
    legal fees.  
  
    Any written filing submitted by the Contractor must contain all  
    elements specified above or it will not be considered to have been  
    filed.  
  
    O.  DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE  
  
  
  
    All Federal grant recipients and sub-recipients must comply with the  
    government-wide requirements for a drug-free workplace, codified at 29  
    CFR part 98.  
  
    P.  DUPLICATION OF BILLED COSTS  
  
  
  
    The Contractor shall not bill the WDC for costs if the Contractor is  
    being paid by another funding source for those same costs.  Duplicate  
    payments shall result in the disallowance of WDC reimbursements.  
  
    Q.  FRAUD, ABUSE, OR OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY  
  
    The Contractor or its subcontractors shall report to the WDC  
    immediately all information and complaints involving suspected fraud,  
    abuse or other suspicious activity (20 CFR 629.55).  The following  
    categories fall under this section:  
  
    Fraud, Misfeasance, Nonfeasance, or Malfeasance:  Any  
    alleged deliberate action that is apparently in violation of Federal  
    statues and regulations.  This category includes, but is not limited  
    to, indications of bribery, forgery, extortion, embezzlement, theft of  
    participant checks, kickbacks from participants, intentional payments  
    to a contractor without the expectation of receiving services,  
    payments to ghost enrollees, misuse of appropriated funds and  
    misrepresenting information in official reports.  
  
    Misapplication of Funds:  Any alleged use of funds, assets  
    or property not authorized or provided for by grantor or regulations,  
    grants or contracts.  This category includes, but is not limited to,  
    nepotism, political patronage, use of participants for political  
    activity, ineligible enrollees, conflict of interest, failure to  
    report income from Federal funds, violation of contract/grant  
    procedure, and using grantor funds for other than specified purposes.  
  
    Gross Mismanagement:  Actions or situations arising out of  
    management ineptitude or oversight which lead to major violations of  
    grantor specifications or processes, regulations, or contract/grant  
    provisions which severely hamper accomplishment of program goals.  
    These include situations that lead to waste of government resources  
    and put into serious jeopardy future support for a particular project.  
    This category includes, but is not limited to, unauditable records,  
    unsupported costs, highly inaccurate fiscal reports and/or program  
    reports, payroll discrepancies, payroll deductions not paid to  
    Internal Revenue Service, and lack of good internal control  
    procedures.  
  
    Employee/Participant Misconduct:  Actions, occurring  
    during or outside work hours, which reflect negatively on the WDC  
    mission.  This may include, but is not limited to, conflict of  
    interest or the appearance of conflict of interest involving outside  
    employment, business, and professional activities; the receipt or  
    giving of gifts, fees, entertainment, and favors; misuse of Federal or  
    State property; misuse of official information; and such other  
    activities as might adversely affect the confidence of the public in  
    the integrity of the Federal or state government, as well as serious  
    violations of Federal and state laws.  
  
    The Contractor should ensure that their personnel and contractors are  
    familiar with the procedures of reporting suspected or known criminal  
    activity or program abuse.  
  
    R.  INDEMNIFICATION  
  
    The Contractor will protect, save, and hold harmless the WDC, or any  
    employees thereof, from and against all claims, suits, actions, costs,  
    damages, or expenses arising from any negligent or deliberate act or  
    omission of the Contractor.  In the case of negligence of both the WDC  
    and the Contractor, any damages allowed shall be levied in proportion  
    to the percentage of negligence attributable to each party.  
  
    S.  INDEPENDENT CAPACITY OF CONTRACTOR  
  
    The parties declare that the Contractor and any agents and employees  
    of the Contractor, in the performance of this Contract, are acting as  
    independent contractors and not in any manner as officers or employees  
    or agents of the WDC or the grantor.  
  
    T.  INDUSTRIAL INSURANCE COVERAGE  
  
    The Contractor shall provide or purchase industrial insurance coverage  
    prior to performing activities under this Contract. The WDC or grantor  
    will not be responsible for payment of industrial insurance premiums  
    or for any other claim or benefits for this Contractor, or any  
    Subgrantee, or employee of the Contractor, which might arise under the  
    industrial insurance laws during the performance of duties and  
    services under this Contract.  Should the Contractor fail to secure  
    industrial insurance coverage or fail to pay premiums on behalf of its  
    employees, the WDC may deduct the amount of premiums owing from the  
    amounts payable to the Contractor under this Grant and transmit the  
    same to the Department of Labor and Industries, Division of Industrial  
    Insurance.  
  
    U.  INSURANCE  
  
    Commercial General Liability Insurance.  The Contractor  
    shall at all times during the term of this Contract, carry and  
    maintain commercial general liability insurance that covers bodily  
    injury, property damage and contractual liability with the following  
    minimum limit:

    29 CFR Part 37.30  
  
    "It is against the law for this recipient of Federal financial  
    assistance to discriminate on the following basis:  
  
    Against any individual in the United States, on the basis of race,  
    color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, political  
    affiliation or belief; and  
  
    Against any beneficiary of programs financially assisted under Title I  
    of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), on the basis of the  
    beneficiary's citizenship/status as a lawfully admitted immigrant  
    authorized to work in the United States, or his or her participation  
    in any WIA Title I-financially assisted program or activity.  
  
    The recipient must not discriminate in any of the following areas:  
    Deciding who will be admitted, or have access, to any WIA Title I-  
    financially assisted program or activity; providing opportunities in,  
    or treating any person with regard to, such a program or activity; or  
    making employment decisions in the administration of, or in connection  
    with, such a program activity.  
  
    If you think that you have been subjected to discrimination under a  
    WIA Title I-financially assisted program or activity, you may file a  
    complaint within 180 days from the date of the alleged violation with  
    either:  the recipient's Equal Opportunity Officer (or person whom the  
    recipient has designated for this purpose); or the Director, Civil  
    Rights Center (CRC), U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue  
    NW, Room N-4123, Washington, DC 20210.  
  
        If you file your complaint with the recipient, you must wait  
    either until the recipient issues a written Notice of Final Action, or  
    until 90 days have passed (whichever is sooner), before filing with  
    the Civil Rights Center (see address above).  
  
    If the recipient does not give you a written Notice of Final Action  
    within 90 days of the day on which you filed your complaint, you do  
    not have to wait for the recipient to issue that Notice before filing  
    a complaint with CRC.  However, you must file your CRC complaint  
    within 30 days of the 90-day deadline (in other words, within 120 days  
    after the day on which you filed your complaint with the recipient).  
  
    If the recipient does give you a written Notice of Final Action on  
    your complaint, but you are dissatisfied with the decision or  
    resolution, you may file a complaint with CRC.  You must file your CRC  
    complaint within 30 days of the date on which you received the Notice  
    of Final Action."

    for any costs incurred by the Contractor unless full contractual  
    performance is provided.

    At no time during the life of this contract shall funds be shifted  
    from or to line items dedicated to participants, staff wages, fringe  
    benefits, indirect costs, out-of-area travel, or equipment purchases  
    without prior written approval of the WDC.  Reasonable movement of  
    funds between other line items within the same cost category is  
    allowed.  The WDC, however, reserves the right to review, question and  
    disallow, if necessary, variances that cannot be adequately explained  
    and supported.  Over expenditure of a cost category is not allowable.

    material breach of contract has occurred.  In these cases, one or more  
    of the following actions may occur:  
  
    (See more details under Exhibit C, 'General Terms and Conditions')  
  
    * Corrective Action:  Whenever possible, the WDC will work with the  
    contractor to come up with a mutually agreeable plan of action to  
    correct the issues resulting in a Corrective Action requirement.  The  
    WDC may require certain actions be taken to correct the issue(s).  
  
    * Contract Modification:  The WDC may modify the contract to adjust  
    budgets or performance requirements to account for the over/under  
    expenditure or performance rates/levels.  
  
    * Adjustments to Invoices/Repayment:  The WDC reserves the right to  
    adjust future invoices or require immediate repayment of reimbursed  
    expenditures if it is determined that the contractor has incorrectly  
    invoiced the WDC, has been reimbursed for costs not allowed under the  
    contract, or been reimbursed in error.  
  
    * Termination of the Contract:  The WDC may decide to terminate the  
    contract in whole, or in part.  
  
    4.  FORMS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

    I. PROGRAM OVERVIEW  
  
  
  
    The City of Seattle will sub-contract with the Seattle Jobs Initiative  
    (SJI) to train 48 low income Seattle residents for careers in desktop  
    and network support.  The goals of this training are to train eligible  
    participants on the skills necessary to become employed as Help Desk  
    Technicians, to expand their earning potential as IT employees, and  
    promote self-sufficiency.  South Seattle Community College (SSCC) is  
    the sole-source vendor to deliver the training.  SSCC developed the  
    new IT Support Technician training program, with input from employers,  
    specifically for SJI.  
  
    II. PROGRAM DESIGN DESCRIPTION  
  
  
  
    SJI will train 48 unemployed and underemployed low income residents  
    for careers as IT Support Technicians (Help Desk) through the  
    following method:  
  
    * Recruiting a source pool of candidates from four community based  
    organizations (CBO's).  All candidates must meet the following  
    eligibility criteria:  18 years of age or older, low income resident  
    (defined as family incomes at or below 175% of the Federal Poverty  
    Guidelines) and a resident of the city of Seattle.  
  
    * The four community based organizations which will provide  
    recruitment, assessment, case management, and two year retention  
    support for participants include:  
  
    Asian Counseling and Referral Service  
  
    Center for Career Alternatives  
  
    TRAC Associates  
  
    YWCA  
  
    * All CBO candidates referred to the training, must complete the  
    following:  
  
    a)  an indepth assessment to determine financial needs and address any  
    barriers to training and employment (transportation, housing, child  
    care, court appointments, etc);  
  
    b)   20 hours of Job Readiness Training;  
  
    c)   an Individual Employment Plan.  
  
    * SJI and its South Seattle Community College vendor will assess  
    candidates' ability to benefit from training by:  
  
    *   Keyboarding test (24 wpm)  
  
    *   Basic Computer test (80% or better)  
  
    *   COMPASS test (Reading, Writing and Math - must be at 10th grade  
    level)  
  
    *   Attendance at two full-days of program orientation  
  
    *   Formal interview by SJI staff and CBO staff  
  
    * Forty-eight (48) participants will be selected from a pool of 90  
    candidates for the program.  No more than 15% (4 students per class)  
    of the selected 48 will drop out of the course work prior to  
    completion. Instructors will complete performance evaluations of all  
    trainees at the completion of every module.  The evaluation  
    information will be shared in formal meetings with trainees, case  
    managers and the training supervisor.   Included in the training will  
    be approximately 20 hours of financial literacy training.  All  
    participants will complete a basic financial literacy course and  
    attend individual appointments with a financial planner.  This work  
    will be followed up during two year retention services.  
  
    * Trainees will earn a total of 58 credits.  
  
    * Participants will be assigned internships as part of the training.  
    Internships supervisors will complete evaluations of trainees.  
  
    * Upon completion of the training graduates will participate in 40  
    hours of interview training and 27 hours of job search clinic.  This  
    activity will link them to a job.  
  
    * Upon being placed into a job, case managers will continue regular  
    follow up activities with clients.  They will assist graduates with  
    making their transition to the job, addressing any personal barriers  
    to staying on the job, and linking them with retention services such  
    as the financial literacy follow up workshops, the Working Wheels  
    program (car ownership), Individual Development Accounts (home  
    ownership), support services, etc.  In addition, case managers and SJI  
    staff will work to customize skill upgrade plans for all graduates.  
  
    * Once the placement phase has been completed, SJI will assess the  
    labor market to verify that there will continue to be significant  
    numbers of IT Support Tech job openings.  SJI will implement a second  
    IT training class, if the assessment determines that the job outlook  
    is positive.  
  
    Support Services:  
  
    Each candidate will be supported by a case manager who will assist in  
    addressing barriers to training and employment, which includes:  
    housing, transportation, child care, medical appointments, ADA  
    accommodations, recovery plans, court appointments, and part-time  
    work, if necessary.  Case managers will have access to SJI's Career  
    Investment Funds to pay for support services that help address the  
    barriers listed above.

    SJI Match  
  
    * SJI will match the training cost with a $429,000 investment (for 2  
    classes) in support services, case management, employer relations,  
    retention and training supervision.  
  
    Sustainability  
  
    Graduates of the IT Support Tech training program will receive 58  
    college credits which can be applied toward an AA certificate.  Once  
    graduates secure employment and have demonstrated stability on the  
    job, case managers will work with participants to link them back to  
    the community college to complete the remaining credits for the AA  
    degree.  In addition, SJI and the case managers will provide two years  
    of retention support once the graduate is placed into a job.

    G.  CHANGES AND MODIFICATIONS

    review.  
  
    J.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST/CODE OF CONDUCT  
  
    Every reasonable course of action will be taken by the Contractor in  
    order to maintain the integrity of this expenditure of public funds  
    and to avoid any favoritism or questionable or improper conduct.  This  
    contract will be administered in an impartial manner, free from  
    personal, financial, or political gain.  The Contractor, its executive  
    staff and employees, in administering this Contract, shall avoid  
    situations that give rise to a suggestion that any decision was  
    influenced by prejudice, bias, special interest, or personal gain.  
  
    Gratuities in the form of entertainment, gifts or otherwise offered by  
    the Contractor, or an agent or representative of the Contractor to any  
    officer or employee of the Grantor or WDC, with a view toward securing  
    this Contract or securing favorable treatment with respect to the  
    awarding or amending or the making of any determination will render  
    this Contract voidable at the option of the WDC and may justify  
    further action under RCW 42.52.  
  
    Contractor shall have a written Code of Conduct for procurement,  
    award, and administration of contracts.  The Code of Conduct regarding  
    the conflict of interest shall contain penalties, sanctions or other  
    disciplinary actions.  The Code of Conduct shall apply to Contractor  
    staff.  The Code of Conduct shall ensure that no one in a decision-  
    making capacity shall have a real or apparent conflict of interest in  
    the selection, award, or administration of contracts or subcontracts.  
    A conflict of interest arises when any of the following have a  
    financial interest or other interest in the firm or organization  
    selected for award:  
  
        a.  Individual,  
  
      b.  Member of the immediate family,  
  
        c.  Employing organization, or  
  
        d.  Future employing organization.  
  
    The officers, employees, or agents of the Contractor making the award  
    will neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of  
    monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to  
    sub-agreements.  Contractor may set minimum rules where the financial  
    interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of  
    nominal intrinsic value.  
  
    A Contractor cannot be involved with decision making if there is a  
    direct financial benefit.  However, Workforce Development Council  
    membership or receipt of funds to provide training and related  
    services do not violate WIA Section 111(f) and Section 117(g).  
  
    K.  CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION  
  
    The Contractor agrees to complete registration with the Department of  
    Revenue, Department of Labor and Industries and Employment Security  
    Tax Administration by having filed a master business application prior  
    to the execution of this Contract and to pay any taxes, fees or  
    deposits required by the state as a condition of providing services  
    under this Contract.  Contractor will provide the WDC with its  
    Washington Unified Business Identifier (UBI) number or its Washington  
    Industries account number and its Unemployment Insurance tax number,  
    if registration with these agencies occurred prior to January 2, 1987,  
    if requested by the WDC.  The required information will be provided  
    prior to the Contractor commencing services under this Contract.  
  
    L.  CORRECTIVE ACTION POLICY AND PROCEDURE  
  
    In the event the WDC determines that a breach of contract, including  
    but not limited to the lack of acceptable performance or suspected  
    fraud, abuse, or other criminal activity has occurred in the  
    Contractor's compliance with the conditions of this contract, and the  
    situation is deemed by the WDC to merit corrective action, the  
    following sequential procedure will be implemented:  
  
    1. The WDC will notify the Contractor formally in writing of the  
    perceived breach of contract and/or the Contractor's lack of  
    acceptable performance;  
  
    2. The Contractor will respond to the WDC's concerns by providing in  
    writing a proposed plan of corrective action including proposed  
    completion date for bringing the contract into compliance.  Such  
    response must be received by the WDC within ten (10) working days of  
    the date of the Contractor's receipt of the WDC's formal notification;  
  
    3. The WDC will notify the Contractor in writing as to the final  
    disposition of the WDC's concerns.  The determination of the  
    sufficiency of the Contractor's corrective action plan and  
    implementation schedule shall be at the sole discretion of the WDC;  
  
    4. If the Contractor does not respond within the appropriate time with  
    a corrective action plan, or fails to implement the plan to the  
    satisfaction of the WDC, the WDC reserves the option of serving a  
    reduction or termination notice on the Contractor that will become  
    effective twenty (20) working days after receipt.  The WDC shall be  
    liable for payment only for services rendered prior to the effective  
    date of the notice provided that such services performed are in  
    accordance with the terms and provisions of this contract.  
  
    If necessary, the WDC reserves the right to suspend, in whole or in  
    part, the contract, and to withhold further payments, or to prohibit  
    the Contractor from incurring additional obligations of funds during  
    investigation of the alleged breach and pending corrective action.  
  
    M.  DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION

    disagrees with the resolution reached, they have 15 calendar days from  
    the date of the WDC's written decision to submit a request for further  
    appeal.  This request, clearly stating the reason for the appeal, the

    remedy sought, shall then be taken before an Administrative Law Judge  
    through the Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings for  
    arbitration in Seattle, Washington.  The arbitrator's findings,  
    decisions, and awards shall be final, binding and conclusive on both  
    the parties hereto and judgment hereto may be entered in any court or

    color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, political  
    affiliation or belief; and  
  
    Against any beneficiary of programs financially assisted under Title I  
    of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), on the basis of the  
    beneficiary's citizenship/status as a lawfully admitted immigrant  
    authorized to work in the United States, or his or her participation  
    in any WIA Title I-financially assisted program or activity.

    Deciding who will be admitted, or have access, to any WIA Title I-

    or treating any person with regard to, such a program or activity; or  
    making employment decisions in the administration of, or in connection  
    with, such a program activity.  
  
    If you think that you have been subjected to discrimination under a  
    WIA Title I-financially assisted program or activity, you may file a  
    complaint within 180 days from the date of the alleged violation with  
    either:  the recipient's Equal Opportunity Officer (or person whom the

    until 90 days have passed (whichever is sooner), before filing with  
    the Civil Rights Center (see address above).  
  
    If the recipient does not give you a written Notice of Final Action  
    within 90 days of the day on which you filed your complaint, you do  
    not have to wait for the recipient to issue that Notice before filing  
    a complaint with CRC.  However, you must file your CRC complaint  
    within 30 days of the 90-day deadline (in other words, within 120 days  
    after the day on which you filed your complaint with the recipient).

    your complaint, but you are dissatisfied with the decision or  
    resolution, you may file a complaint with CRC.  You must file your CRC  
    complaint within 30 days of the date on which you received the Notice  
    of Final Action."

    Section 2:  SELECTION OF IT COACHES  
  
  
  
    Within sixty (60) days from the execution of this Agreement by Mayor  
    Nickels, the Union shall notify the Director of the Department of  
    Information Technology's Strategic Planning Section of the names of up  
    to ten City of Seattle employees, who are members of the bargaining  
    unit represented by the Union and who shall serve for the duration of  
    this Agreement as Union Information Technology Coaches (hereinafter  
    "IT Coaches") as described herein.  
  
    Prior to designating assignments, the Union will work with the  
    managers of potential IT Coaches to ensure that it is acceptable to  
    select those individuals, as well as to ensure that the schedules of  
    the IT Coaches do not disrupt City work.  
  
    If it becomes necessary during the term of this Agreement to replace  
    an IT Coach for whatever reason (e.g. resignation, retirement long-  
    term illness, assignment conflicts, etc), the Union shall notify the  
    Director of the Department of Information Technology's Strategic  
    Planning Section of the name of the Information Technology employee  
    who is a member of the bargaining unit represented by the Union who  
    shall serve as said replacement within twenty-one (21) days of the  
    date the Union gained knowledge that the original IT Coach became  
    unavailable.   Prior to selecting the replacement, the Union will work  
    with the manager of a potential IT Coach replacement to ensure that it  
    is acceptable to select the individual, as well as to ensure that the  
    schedule of the replacement will not disrupt City work.

    their duties and responsibilities which are as follows:  
  
    * Facilitate communication about the H-1B training program to  
    represented employees;  
  
    * Communicate training opportunities to represented employees and keep  
    the City's IT Coach/Grant Manager informed of training opportunities;  
  
    * Recruit represented employees to apply for H-1B funds;  
  
    * Facilitate review and completion of training plans;  
  
    * Assist represented employees with filling out their portion of the  
    H-1B application;  
  
    * Facilitate assessment of represented employees who are eligible for  
    H-1B grant funds to ensure they have the correct prerequisites to take  
    their requested training;  
  
    * Submit appropriate monthly status reports describing any work  
    performed pursuant to this scope of work and the time associated with  
    said work; and,  
  
    * Facilitate mentoring and career guidance to represented employees.  
  
    The minimum qualifications for an IT Coach shall be a bachelors degree  
    plus one year of relevant work experience in IT Training or in one or  
    more of the ten H-1B skill areas, or the equivalent work experience in  
    the IT training or IT field.  
  
    The work shall, at all times, be subject to the general review and  
    approval of the Director of the Department of Information Technology's  
    Strategic Planning Section and the Union Representative.  The IT  
    Coaches shall confer with the Director of the Department of  
    Information Technology's Strategic Planning Section and the Union  
    Representative periodically during the progress of the work, and shall  
    prepare and present such information and materials (e.g., a detailed  
    outline of completed work) as may be pertinent, necessary, or  
    requested by the Director of the Department of Information  
    Technology's Strategic Planning Section and the Union Representative.  
  
    Section 4:  PAYMENT OF IT COACHES FOR WORK PERFORMED  
  
  
  
    The maximum amount to be paid to departments for loss of time for all  
    Union IT coaching in the aggregate for the work defined in Section 3,  
    SCOPE OF WORK shall be $34,060.46 for the duration of this Agreement,  
    which is the total budgeted amount in the City's contract with the  
    Workforce Development Council (WDC) of Seattle-King County for this  
    body of work.  
  
    Prior to performing any coaching duties, IT Coaches shall be provided  
    a special job code exclusively applicable to the work performed  
    pursuant to this Agreement.  Based upon the coordinated planning  
    between the Union and IT Coaches' managers, each IT Coach will be  
    informed of the maximum number of hours available for coaching and the  
    expected timeline for utilizing those hours.  Each IT Coach shall  
    designate on his/her timesheet for any applicable pay period any time  
    that shall be paid pursuant to this special job code.  Said  
    compensation shall be in lieu of compensation that otherwise would  
    have been paid to the IT Coach as a regular City employee.  Unless  
    explicitly authorized in advance by the Director of the Department of  
    Information Technology's Strategic Planning Section, no compensation  
    paid for work performed pursuant to this Agreement shall be on an  
    overtime basis, and, further, no work performed pursuant to this  
    Agreement shall cause a situation whereby an IT Coach is due overtime  
    pay for work performed as a regular City employee.  
  
    The Director of the Department of Information Technology's Strategic  
    Planning Section and the Union Representative who is a signatory to  
    this Agreement shall monitor compensation paid to IT Coaches on a  
    monthly basis to insure compliance with this Agreement with respect to  
    overtime issues and total compensation in the aggregate available  
    pursuant to this Agreement.  
  
    It shall be the responsibility of the Union Representative who is a  
    signatory to this Agreement to collect and retain the status reports  
    of the IT Coaches for the work defined in Section 3, SCOPE OF WORK.  
    Even though the IT Coaches' managers will track their staff's time,  
    the Union Representative and Director of the Department of Information  
    Technology's Strategic Planning Section will insure IT Coaches  
    performing their duties within the prescribed budget.  
  
    Section 5:  RESOLUTION OF UNANTICIPATED ISSUES AND DISPUTES  
  
    Any unanticipated issue that may arise in the course of implementing  
    this Agreement, or any dispute or misunderstanding that may arise  
    under this Agreement concerning an IT Coaches' performance or the  
    interpretation or application of any provisions of this Agreement  
    shall first be resolved through amicable discussions.  If the parties  
    do not agree upon a decision within a reasonable period of time, the  
    parties may submit the issue in question to mediation, pursuant to the  
    IFPTE Collective Bargaining Agreement, and to binding arbitration  
    under said Agreement if the issue involves the interpretation or  
    application of any provisions of this Agreement.
