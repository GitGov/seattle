    ORDINANCE _________________  
  
    AN ORDINANCE relating to the Neighborhood Parks, Green Spaces, Trails,  
    and Zoo Levy; authorizing the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation  
    to acquire real property and property rights within certain designated  
    Green Spaces; and amending the 2003 Adopted Budget of the Department  
    of Parks and Recreation by making appropriations from the 2000 Parks  
    Levy Fund; all by a three-fourths vote of the City Council.  
  
    WHEREAS, Ordinance 120024 proposed the Neighborhood Parks, Green  
    Spaces, Trails, and Zoo Levy (hereafter, 2000 Parks Levy) to provide  
    funding for, among other things, "acquisition of properties to fill  
    gaps in the existing public ownership and preserve continuity within  
    the City's designated Green Spaces (greenbelts and natural areas)";  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, the voters of Seattle approved the 2000 Parks Levy on  
    November 7, 2000; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Acquisition category of the 2000 Parks Levy allocates Ten  
    Million Dollars ($10,000,000) to the Green Spaces subcategory for the  
    acquisition of critical properties within the City's designated Green  
    Spaces; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Ordinance 120024 established a Parks and Green Spaces Levy  
    Oversight Committee (hereafter, Oversight Committee), with  
    responsibilities to include making recommendations on the  
    implementation of particular projects and programs; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City has made significant progress in preserving  
    undeveloped lands within its designated Green Spaces by means of  
    property acquisitions funded by the 1968 Forward Thrust and the 1989  
    Open Space and Trails bond issues, as well as by transfers of  
    jurisdiction and voluntary conservation; and  
  
    WHEREAS, a large number of privately owned properties that merit City  
    acquisition remain in the designated Green Spaces, the total fair  
    market values of which would greatly exceed the Ten Million Dollar  
    allocation in the Green Spaces subcategory of the 2000 Parks Levy; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Oversight Committee has reviewed and affirmed a list of  
    designated Green Spaces within which City acquisitions should be given  
    priority and has proposed an allocation of the remaining funds in the  
    Green Spaces subcategory of the 2000 Parks Levy; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Acquisition category of the 2000 Parks Levy program  
    allocates Sixteen Million Dollars ($16,000,000) for Neighborhood Park  
    Acquisitions, some of which are also located within the City's  
    designated Green Spaces; NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

    to execute such documents as he deems necessary or desirable to  
    accomplish the acquisitions.
