    ORDINANCE _________________  
  
    AN ORDINANCE establishing a "Seattle Animal Shelter Expansion"  
    Subfund in the General Donations and Gift Trust Fund; and authorizing  
    the Director of Executive Administration to expend such funds.  
  
    WHEREAS, the Seattle Animal Shelter was built over two decades ago;  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, since 1996, the Seattle Animal Shelter's programs and  
    services have expanded to include exemplary, nationally recognized  
    volunteer and foster care programs with over 600 volunteers providing  
    support to the Seattle Animal Shelter, resulting in over 80,000 hours  
    of volunteer and foster care support in 2002; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the number of animals adopted from the Seattle Animal  
    Shelter has nearly doubled in the past five years, saving several  
    thousand wonderful pets from euthanasia every year; and  
  
    WHEREAS, expanding the Seattle Animal Shelter would improve current  
    programs and services offered to the community by providing needed  
    space for volunteer training, community education, adoption events  
    and disaster readiness, and would greatly enhance the shelter's  
    ability to increase adoptions and decrease euthanasia of innocent  
    companion animals; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Seattle Animal Shelter, through the concerted efforts of  
    the volunteer program and shelter staff, has garnered impressive  
    community support, demonstrated by over $700,000 in donations within  
    the last seven years; and  
  
    WHEREAS, it is the express intent of the Animal Control Program to  
    raise from non-City sources the funding needed to complete the  
    expansion project, with the City providing the funds for final design  
    in 2008 or 2009 if private funding is secured; NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1.  There is hereby established a subfund entitled the  
    "Seattle Animal Shelter Expansion" Subfund in the General Donations  
    and Gift Trust Fund of the City, into which subfund shall be  
    deposited donations to be used for activities related to expansion of  
    the Seattle Animal Shelter.  
  
    Section 2.  Funds in the "Seattle Animal Shelter Expansion " Subfund  
    may be expended from time to time, upon vouchers signed by the  
    Director of Executive Administration, for activities associated with  
    expansion of the Seattle Animal Shelter, as well as for fundraising  
    activities for that project, consistent with the purpose of Section  
    1.  
  
    Funds in the "Seattle Animal Shelter Expansion" Subfund are  
    distinguished from, and shall not be commingled with funds in the  
    "Help the Animals Account" (established by Ordinance 108357), the  
    "Off-Leash Area Account" (established by Ordinance 118097), and the  
    "Pet Population Control Fund" (established by Ordinance 118289),  
    except as provided in Section 3.  
  
    Section 3.  Any donations deposited in the "Seattle Animal Shelter  
    Expansion" Subfund that remain unexpended upon completion of the  
    Seattle Animal Shelter expansion shall be transferred to the "Help  
    the Animals Account" in the General Donations and Gift Trust Fund,  
    and used for purposes established by Ordinance 108357.  If the  
    Director of Executive Administration determines at any time that it  
    is not in the City's best interest to proceed with the Seattle Animal  
    Shelter expansion, unexpended donations deposited in the "Seattle  
    Animal Shelter Expansion" Subfund may be transferred to the "Help the  
    Animals Account" in the General Donations and Gift Trust Fund, at the  
    Director's discretion, and used for the purposes established by  
    Ordinance 108357.  
  
    Section 4.  This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty  
    (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not  
    approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after  
    presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code  
    Section 1.04.020.
