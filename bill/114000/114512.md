    ORDINANCE _____________________  
  
    AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning of adult cabarets,  
    extending the moratorium on the issuance of use permits, and on the  
    acceptance of applications for use permits or building permits, for  
    adult entertainment premises as defined in SMC 6.270.  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
      Section 1.  The City Council hereby adopts the following findings of  
    fact:  
  
      a.  There are a number of adult cabarets located near residential  
    areas throughout the City;  
  
      b.  There is growing evidence that such uses constitute a threat to  
    the public health, safety, and welfare;  
  
      c.  In April 2002, the City Council passed and the Mayor signed  
    Ordinance 120779 establishing a moratorium through June 30, 2003 on  
    new adult cabarets within the City pending additional City analysis  
    and evaluation;  
  
      d.  The United States Supreme Court recently issued a decision in  
    the case City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., related to zoning  
    restrictions that prohibit more than one adult entertainment business  
    in the same building, and the City of Seattle needs to analyze the  
    Court's ruling and its implications for Seattle;  
  
      e.  The City Council of Auburn, Washington imposed a moratorium on  
    the filing of any applications for licenses, permits, or approvals for  
    sexually-oriented businesses, and recently extended the moratorium  
    while the City of Auburn and its Planning Commission continue their  
    study and evaluation of the issues involved in sexually-oriented  
    businesses and develop recommendations for zoning code and land use  
    regulations for sexually-oriented businesses, and the City of Seattle  
    needs to review and analyze the results of the City of Auburn's study  
    and evaluation, including recommendations for any new legislation;  
  
      f.  The Seattle City Council has developed a work plan for  
    developing and evaluating land use code amendments for adult  
    entertainment uses; and  
  
      g.  This Council therefore finds that the protection of the public  
    health, safety, and welfare requires extending the moratorium on new  
    adult cabarets.  
  
      Section 2.  Through June 30, 2004 or until new land use regulations  
    governing the location of adult cabarets take effect, whichever is  
    sooner, no use permit shall be issued, nor shall any use permit  
    application or building permit application be accepted, for any new  
    adult entertainment premises as defined in SMC 6.270.  
  
      Section 3.  Pursuant to SMC 25.05.880, the City Council finds that  
    an exemption under SEPA for this action is necessary to prevent an  
    imminent threat to public health and safety and to prevent an imminent  
    threat of serious environmental degradation through continued  
    development under the existing regulations.  SEPA review of any  
    permanent regulations proposed for replacement of the existing zoning  
    shall be conducted.  
  
      Section 4.  This Ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty  
    days from and after its passage and approval, if approved by the  
    Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect at the time it shall become a  
    law under the provisions of the city charter.
