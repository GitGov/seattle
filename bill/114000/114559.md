    WHEREAS, in 1997, voters in the City of Seattle (the "City") approved  
    Initiative 41, establishing the Elevated Transportation Company  
    ("ETC") to study and make recommendations for the construction of a  
    significantly expanded monorail mass transit system in the city; and  
  
    WHEREAS, in 2000, voters in the City of Seattle approved Initiative  
    53, which provided City funding for the ETC and its planning process,  
    with the goal of having the ETC prepare a proposal to be submitted to  
    the voters to create an expanded monorail transportation system; and  
  
    WHEREAS, on November 5, 2002, pursuant to Petition/Proposition No. 1  
    and 2002 Washington Laws, Chapter 248 (substantially codified in the  
    Revised Code of Washington as RCW Chapter 35.95A), voters in the City  
    of Seattle created a city transportation authority (the Seattle  
    Popular Monorail Authority, or "Seattle Monorail Project") to provide  
    a monorail transportation system as set forth in the Seattle Popular  
    Monorail Plan adopted by the ETC on August 5, 2002 (the "ETC Plan");  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, the creation of the Seattle Monorail Project to implement the  
    ETC Plan fulfills the purposes of the ETC and addresses the goals of  
    Initiative 41 and Initiative 53; and  
  
    WHEREAS, provision has been made for addressing the goals of  
    Initiative 41 and Initiative 53, and  
  
    WHEREAS, the ETC, through adoption of ETC Resolution 03-01, requested  
    that Initiative 41 and Initiative 53 be repealed; and  
  
    WHEREAS, for the above reasons it is in the best interests of the City  
    and its citizens that Initiative 41 and Initiative 53 be repealed;
