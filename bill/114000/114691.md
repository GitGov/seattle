    AN ORDINANCE prohibiting deceptive and fraudulent practices related to  
    third party billing for master metered or other unmetered utility  
    services provided to multi-unit buildings as a whole; and adding a new  
    chapter to Title 7 of the Seattle Municipal Code.  
  
    WHEREAS, many utility services provided to residential multi-unit  
    buildings in the City of Seattle are billed by the utility on a master  
    metered or unmetered basis, and the landlord or property owner is  
    responsible for paying the utility for all charges contained in such  
    bills; and  
  
    WHEREAS, historically, most landlords in the City of Seattle have  
    recouped the amounts they have paid for such utility services in the  
    monthly rental rates they charge their tenants; and  
  
    WHEREAS, with increasing frequency, residential landlords and property  
    owners are recouping utility charges by billing tenants for master  
    metered or unmetered utility services, either themselves or through a  
    third party agent, instead of including such costs within the monthly  
    rent; and  
  
    WHEREAS, some of these billing demands on tenants have come without  
    prior notice or agreement and without explanation of the methods used  
    to allocate the utility bills; and  
  
    WHEREAS, certain bills for utility services are being sent to tenants  
    by third parties that may be required to be, but are not, licensed  
    and/or registered to do business in the State of Washington or the  
    City of Seattle; and  
  
    WHEREAS, certain bills include unreasonable and unjustified  
    administrative fees and excessive late fees and penalties, or do not  
    adequately inform tenants of the basis of any fees or penalties  
    imposed; and  
  
    WHEREAS, provisions requiring disclosure of significant information  
    concerning billing of master metered or unmetered utility service  
    would enable tenants to better understand the costs and allocation  
    methods reflected in the utility bills and would more accurately  
    reflect the actual costs of utilities; and  
  
    WHEREAS, tenants and occupants of individual units currently have  
    little or no recourse by which they can dispute or inquire about bills  
    for master metered or unmetered utility service or can challenge  
    billing practices, and are being deprived of the benefit of consumer  
    protection laws; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City Council intends to continue monitoring the impacts  
    of billing of master metered or unmetered utility service, to consider  
    the requirement of submetering and the banning of RUBS, and to review  
    whether the provisions of this ordinance have provided a sufficient  
    degree of consumer protection for tenants and reasonable requirements  
    for landlords;  
  
    NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1.  A new chapter is added to Seattle Municipal Code Title 7  
    to read as follows:  
  
    Chapter 7.25  
  
    THIRD PARTY BILLING REGULATION  
  
    7.25.010  Short title and purpose.  
  
    A.  This chapter may be known and be cited as "Third Party Billing  
    Regulation."  The general purpose of this chapter is to prevent  
    landlords, either themselves or through a third party billing agent,  
    from billing tenants for master metered or other unmetered utility  
    services without proper notice and disclosure of billing practices to  
    tenants, and to protect tenants from deceptive or fraudulent billing  
    practices, and to these ends the provisions of this chapter shall be  
    liberally construed.  
  
    B.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a landlord  
    from including a tenant's cost of master metered or other unmetered  
    utility services within the rent set forth in a rental agreement, and  
    the practice of including such cost within a tenant's rent shall not  
    be considered a billing practice or methodology affected by the  
    provisions of this chapter.  
  
    C.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect the practices  
    used by Seattle Public Utilities or Seattle City Light to bill and  
    collect residential multi-unit building owners or landlords for master  
    metered or other unmetered utility service.  
  
    7.25.020  Definitions.  
  
    As used in this chapter:  
  
    A.  "Billing entity" means the landlord or third party billing agent,  
    as the case may be, responsible for billing residential multi-unit  
    building tenants for master metered or other unmetered utility  
    service.  
  
    B.  "Disclosure" means providing tenants with complete and accurate  
    written information in a clear, concise, and understandable manner in  
    all notices required under this chapter and on each bill presented  
    from the billing entity to tenants.  
  
    C.  "Landlord" means a "landlord" as defined in and within the scope  
    of RCW 59.18.030 and RCW 59.18.040 of the Residential Landlord Tenant  
    Act of 1973 ("RLTA") in effect at the time the rental agreement is  
    executed, and shall also mean the owner of a mobile home park or boat  
    moorage.  At the time of passage of the ordinance codified in this  
    chapter, RLTA defined "landlord" as "the owner, lessor, or sublessor  
    of the dwelling unit or the property of which it is a part," and  
    included "any person designated as representative of the landlord."  
  
      D.  "Master metered utility service" means a utility service  
    supplied to more than one (1) unit in a multi-unit building and  
    measured through a single inclusive metering system.  
  
    E.  "Methodology" refers to any method, technique, or criterion used  
    to apportion to tenants charges billed to the landlord by the utility  
    for master metered utility service or unmetered utility service,  
    including but not limited to Ratio Utility Billing Systems,  
    installation of submetering, and hot water metering.  
  
    F.  "Multi-unit building" refers to a residential building or group of  
    buildings (which may include a mobile home park or boat moorage) with  
    3 or more tenant units with a master metered utility service or  
    unmetered utility service, such as solid waste collection, that is  
    provided to the building or group of buildings as a whole.  
  
    G.  "Personally identifiable information" means specific information  
    about a tenant, including but not limited to the tenant's social  
    security number, birth date, mother's maiden name, banking data or  
    information, or any other personal or private information.  
  
    H.  "Ratio Utility Billing System" or "RUBS" refers to any methodology  
    by which the cost of master metered or other unmetered utility service  
    provided to tenants and common areas of a multi-unit building is  
    apportioned to tenants through the use of a formula that estimates the  
    utility usage of each rental unit in the building based on the number  
    of occupants in a unit, number of bedrooms in a unit, square footage  
    of a unit, or any similar criterion.  
  
    I.  "Rental agreement" means a "rental agreement" as defined in and  
    within the scope of RCW 59.18.030 and RCW 59.18.040 of the RLTA in  
    effect at the time the rental agreement is executed, and is deemed to  
    include any month-to-month tenancy arrangement, whether written or  
    oral.  At the time of the passage of the ordinance codified in this  
    chapter, the RLTA defined "rental agreement" as "all agreements which  
    establish or modify the terms, conditions, rules, regulations, or any  
    other provisions concerning the use and occupancy of a dwelling unit."  
  
    J.  "Service charge" refers to any charge or fee imposed by the  
    billing entity to cover the costs of providing or administering the  
    billing practices, regardless of the label applied to such charge or  
    fee.  
  
    K.  "Tenant" means a  "tenant" as defined in and within the scope of  
    RCW 59.18.030 and RCW 59.18.040 of the RLTA in effect at the time the  
    rental agreement is executed, and shall also mean a tenant of a mobile  
    home park or boat moorage.  At the time of passage of the ordinance  
    codified in this chapter, the RLTA defined "tenant" as "any person who  
    is entitled to occupy a dwelling unit primarily for living or dwelling  
    purposes under a rental agreement."  
  
    L.  "Billing practices" refers to the practices of a landlord or third  
    party billing agent, as defined herein, that bills residential multi-  
    unit building tenants for the purpose of apportioning master metered  
    or other unmetered utility services provided to the building(s) as a  
    whole, either by directly submetering tenants' usage or by otherwise  
    apportioning such utility services among tenants, and also refers to  
    any practices related thereto, including but not limited to  
    collecting, using or disclosing tenants' personally identifiable  
    information (other than name and address), attempting to collect  
    unpaid amounts from tenants, verifying tenants' credit, and reporting  
    unpaid balances to credit reporting agencies.  
  
    M.  "Third party billing agent" refers to any entity retained or  
    authorized by a landlord to bill tenants for master metered or other  
    unmetered utility service on behalf of and as the agent of a landlord.  
  
    N.  "Utilities" or "utility service(s)" refers to water, sewer,  
    electric, and solid waste services.  
  
    7.25.030  Prohibited billing practices.  
  
      A.  It is a deceptive and fraudulent business practice for any  
    landlord or third party billing agent to bill tenants separately for  
    utility services except as permitted in this chapter.  
  
      B.  It is a deceptive and fraudulent business practice for a  
    landlord to engage, retain, or authorize, and a landlord shall be  
    liable for the actions of, a third party billing agent that does not  
    comply with the requirements of this chapter.  
  
      C.  As of the effective date of this ordinance, no landlord may  
    disclose to a third party billing agent a tenant's personally  
    identifiable information under any circumstances, provided, however,  
    that nothing in this chapter shall prevent a landlord from disclosing  
    a tenant's name and address to a third party billing agent for the  
    purpose of engaging in permitted billing practices.  
  
      D.  A third party billing agent who prior to the effective date of  
    this ordinance has obtained any tenant's personally identifiable  
    information (other than name and address) shall not use, sell, convey,  
    or otherwise disclose that personally identifiable information to any  
    other person, except as expressly permitted in this chapter, and must  
    destroy all such information upon a tenant's request, when the tenancy  
    terminates and the account is paid, or when the landlord terminates  
    the third party billing agency relationship.  
  
      E.  No third party billing agent may inform a credit reporting  
    agency of a claim against a tenant except as expressly permitted in  
    RCW Chapter 19.16, regardless of whether the third party billing agent  
    is licensed by the state pursuant to that chapter.  
  
      7.25.040  Billing requirements.  
  
    A.  Notwithstanding the prohibition against submetering electric  
    service in SMC 21.49.100(G), a landlord may, itself or through a third  
    party billing agent, bill tenants for master metered or other  
    unmetered utility services, including electric service provided to  
    tenants of multi-unit buildings, provided that the following  
    requirements are met:  
  
    1.  Notice   Billing practices may be adopted only upon advance  
    written notice to a tenant as part of a new or renewed rental  
    agreement.  Tenants must receive such written notice at least 90 days  
    before expiration of their rental agreements, or, in the case of  
    month-to-month tenancies, at least 90 days before any such billing  
    practices may become effective.  Notwithstanding the foregoing two  
    sentences, if billing practices are already in place at the time the  
    ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective, written notice  
    must be given within 30 days of the effective date of the ordinance  
    codified in this chapter.  
  
    2.  Methodology   The notice required under section A.1 above must  
    include a copy of this chapter and a detailed written disclosure of  
    the methodology used by the billing agent to allocate the charges to  
    each tenant, including the methodology used to allocate utility  
    services for common areas of the building, along with all other terms  
    and conditions of the billing arrangement.  If submetering is used,  
    the notice required under section A.1 shall also include descriptions  
    of the location of the submeter and of the access requirements, if  
    any, required by the landlord for access to tenant units for submeter  
    installation, reading, repair, maintenance, or inspections, including  
    removal of the submeter for testing, consistent with the provisions of  
    RCW 59.18.150 of the RLTA.  An additional written notice must also be  
    given at least 30 days prior to the due date of the next rental  
    payment in order to implement a change in billing agents,  
    apportionment methodology, fees, or other terms and conditions of the  
    billing arrangement.  
  
    3.  Posting of Information  
  
    a. In addition to the written notification required by subsection A.2.  
    above, any landlord employing billing practices shall post in a  
    conspicuous public space in the interior of the building copies of the  
    three most current utility bills for master metered or other unmetered  
    utility services provided to the building as a whole that are included  
    in the bill sent to the tenant, together with a written description of  
    the methodology used to allocate each such utility service and a copy  
    of this chapter.  
  
    b. Where such posting is physically impracticable due to the absence  
    of a suitable conspicuous public space, a landlord may satisfy this  
    posting requirement by hand-delivering or mailing to tenants a paper  
    copy of the written notification required by subsection A.2, together  
    with a written description of the methodology used to allocate each  
    such utility service and a copy of this chapter.  In lieu of posting  
    the three most current utility bills for master metered or other  
    unmetered utility services provided to the building as a whole that  
    are included in the bill sent to the tenant, the landlord must make  
    such utility bills available upon request within 5 business days and  
    must inform tenants in the written notification required by subsection  
    A.2 of the method by which they may request such utility bills.  
  
    c. Landlords shall keep bills for master metered or other unmetered  
    utility services on file in the building for at least two years and  
    shall make such bills available to tenants for inspection and copying  
    upon request.  Where it is physically impracticable to keep such bills  
    on file due to the absence of a suitable office or other storage  
    space, a landlord may store the bills in another location and must  
    make such bills available within 5 business days of receiving a  
    request from a tenant.  
  
    4.  Limitations on Charges   The total of all charges for any utility  
    service included in the bills sent to all units cumulatively shall not  
    exceed the amount of the bill sent by the utility itself for the  
    building as a whole, less any late charges, interest or other  
    penalties owed by the landlord, with the exception of the following,  
    which may be included in each bill covering an independent unit within  
    the multi-unit building:  
  
    a.  A service charge of no more than $2 per utility per month, not to  
    exceed a cumulative service charge of $5 per month for all the  
    utilities included in any bill.  
  
    b. Late payment charges of no more than $5 per month plus interest at  
    a rate not to exceed 1% per month, which late payment charge shall not  
    accrue until at least 30 days after the tenant receives the bill.  
  
    c. Insufficient funds check charges for dishonored checks, not to  
    exceed $31 per dishonored check.  
  
    5.  Licensing of Third Party Billing Agents   Any third party billing  
    agent must be properly registered and licensed to do business in the  
    State of Washington and City of Seattle and must be in compliance with  
    all applicable Washington state and Seattle laws and regulations, and  
    all applicable Washington and Seattle license identification numbers,  
    if any, must be disclosed upon request.  
  
    6.  Content of Bills   Each billing statement sent to a tenant by a  
    billing entity must disclose all required information in a clear and  
    conspicuous manner and at minimum must:  
  
    a. Include the name, business address & telephone number of the  
    billing entity;  
  
    b. Identify and show the basis for each separate charge, including  
    service charges and late charges, if any, as a line item, and show the  
    total amount of the bill;  
  
    c. If the building units are submetered, include the current and  
    previous meter readings, the current read date, and the amount  
    consumed (or estimated to have been consumed if Seattle Public  
    Utilities or Seattle City Light has provided the landlord with an  
    estimated bill);  
  
    d. Specify the due date, the date upon which the bill becomes overdue,  
    the amount of any late charges or penalties that may apply, and the  
    date upon which such late charges or penalties may be imposed;  
  
    e. Identify any past due dollar amounts;  
  
    f. Identify a mailing address and telephone number for billing  
    inquiries and disputes, identify the entity responsible for resolving  
    billing inquiries and disputes and its business hours and days of  
    availability, and describe the process used to resolve disputes  
    related to bills as set forth in this chapter; and  
  
    g. Include a statement to the effect that "this bill is from [landlord  
    name] and not from Seattle Public Utilities or Seattle City Light."  
  
    7. Protection of Personally Identifiable Information  
  
    a. A third party billing agent who prior to the effective date of this  
    ordinance has obtained a tenant's personally identifiable information  
    shall take such actions as are necessary to protect such personally  
    identifiable information and to prevent its use or disclosure except  
    as expressly permitted in this chapter.  
  
    b. A third party billing agent who prior to the effective date of this  
    ordinance has obtained a tenant's personally identifiable information  
    may disclose such personally identifiable information only to the  
    extent necessary to render its billing services.  
  
    c. To the extent required by federal, state, or local law, a billing  
    entity may disclose personally identifiable information in its  
    possession (i) pursuant to a subpoena or valid court order authorizing  
    such disclosure, or (ii) to a governmental entity.  
  
    8.   Estimated Billing   If Seattle Public Utilities or Seattle City  
    Light has billed the landlord using an estimate of utility service  
    consumed, the billing agent may estimate the charges to be billed to  
    tenants until billing based on actual consumption resumes.  Upon  
    receipt of a corrected bill showing that the estimated bill overstated  
    charges, the landlord must refund the difference to tenants.  Upon  
    receipt of a corrected bill showing that the estimated bill  
    understated charges, the landlord may attempt to recover the  
    underpayment from the tenants that actually incurred the charges  
    during the billing period, but shall not attempt to recover an  
    underpayment from a tenant who did not reside in the unit during the  
    billing period in which the charges were incurred.  
  
    9.  Submetering   Submetering is permitted as a way of allocating  
    master metered utility services to tenants provided the following  
    conditions are met:  
  
    a.  The submeters must be read prior to each billing.  
  
    b.  A landlord may not enter a unit without, and a tenant may not  
    unreasonably withhold, consent to enter the unit in order to perform  
    submeter installation, reading, repair, maintenance, and inspection,  
    including removal of the submeter for testing, provided, however, that  
    a landlord may enter a unit without a tenant's consent in the case of  
    a submeter leak or emergency related to that unit's submeter.  
  
    c.  If a tenant contests the accuracy of the submeter, the tenant  
    shall have the option of demanding an independent test of the meter  
    through the Consumer Affairs Division of the Department of Executive  
    Administration.  If the meter reads within a 5% range of accuracy, the  
    tenant requesting the test shall pay the cost of the meter test.  If  
    the meter reads outside a 5% range of accuracy, the landlord shall pay  
    for the cost of the meter test and within 30 days refund any  
    overpayments for the past three months based on a recalculation of the  
    past year's billings by correcting for the inaccuracy of the submeter.  
    Submetering thereafter shall only be permitted with a repaired  
    submeter.  
  
      B.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a landlord  
    from addressing billing of master metered or other unmetered utility  
    services in a written addendum to a lease.  A lease addendum may be  
    used to give the notice required under subsection A.1 of this  
    subsection, so long as the lease addendum is provided to the tenant  
    with the notice required under that subsection, and so long as all  
    other requirements of this chapter are satisfied.  
  
      7.25.050  Dispute resolution and remedies.  
  
      A.  A dispute regarding the amount of charges or other terms and  
    conditions contained in a bill shall be resolved as follows:  
  
        1.  The tenant must notify the entity responsible for billing  
    disputes as identified in the bill ("Responsible Entity") of the  
    nature of and reason for the dispute by calling the number shown on  
    the bill or by writing a letter to the Responsible Entity within 30  
    days of receiving the bill.  The tenant must have a good faith basis  
    for any such dispute.  
  
        2.  Within 30 days of receiving notice of a billing dispute, the  
    Responsible Entity must contact the tenant to discuss the dispute, and  
    the Responsible Entity and tenant must determine the amount of  
    disputed and undisputed charges.  The tenant must pay all undisputed  
    charges within 30 days of reaching agreement with the Responsible  
    Entity.  
  
        3.  No late fees or interest charges shall accrue on any disputed  
    portions of a bill while the amount is being resolved in accordance  
    with subsections A.1 and 2, and no collection activity related to the  
    disputed portions of a bill may be instituted against a tenant that  
    has notified the Responsible Entity of a dispute in accordance with  
    this chapter.  
  
        4.  The tenant and Responsible Entity shall continue to discuss in  
    good faith any remaining disputed amounts and attempt to reach an  
    agreement on the amount due, if any, within 60 days of the Responsible  
    Entity's receipt of notice of a billing dispute.  If a tenant is  
    unable to reach a satisfactory resolution of any portion of a disputed  
    charge within the allotted time, the tenant may exercise any of the  
    remedies set forth in Section B below or any other available remedies,  
    provided, however, that if within 120 days of the Responsible Entity's  
    receipt of notice of a billing dispute, the tenant has not either  
    exercised one of the remedies set forth in Section B or paid the  
    remaining disputed amounts, the landlord may exercise any legal or  
    equitable remedies available to it to collect the unpaid amounts, and  
    provided further that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to  
    deprive a landlord of its right to exercise any legal or equitable  
    remedies available to it against a tenant that has not paid any  
    undisputed charges, has not followed the procedures set forth in this  
    section, or has not exercised good faith in disputing a charge.  
  
      B.  If a tenant believes that it has been or will be subject to  
    billing practices that violate any provision set forth in this  
    chapter, the tenant may, at its option, file a complaint against the  
    landlord with the Office of the Hearing Examiner or institute a civil  
    action against the landlord, as follows:  
  
        1.  The Office of the Hearing Examiner is hereby vested with the  
    authority to hear and resolve tenant complaints against landlords  
    regarding billing practices in accordance with its rules and  
    procedures then in force governing contested cases.  The filing fee  
    for such a case shall be set at $5.00.  Upon the finding of a  
    violation of this chapter, the Hearing Examiner shall award actual  
    damages (including but not limited to refund of any overpayment or  
    other fees or charges resulting from such violation, and costs of  
    pursuing the claim) and a penalty of one hundred dollars, and may  
    permit the tenant to terminate the rental agreement by written notice  
    in accordance with RCW 59.18.090.  If the Hearing Examiner determines  
    that the landlord engaged in  prohibited billing practices in  
    deliberate violation of this chapter, the penalty mentioned in the  
    preceding sentence shall be two hundred dollars, and the Hearing  
    Examiner shall also award attorneys' fees to the tenant.  A final  
    order or decision of the Hearing Examiner may be subject to judicial  
    review in the King County Superior Court in accordance with the  
    Hearing Examiner's rules and procedures.  
  
        2.  In the alternative, a tenant may institute a civil action  
    against the landlord.  Upon a finding that a landlord engaged in  
    billing practices that violate this chapter, the court shall award  
    actual damages (including but not limited to refund of any overpayment  
    or other fees or charges resulting from such violation, and costs of  
    pursuing the claim) and a penalty of one hundred dollars, and may  
    permit the tenant to terminate the rental agreement by written notice  
    in accordance with RCW 59.18.090.  If the court determines that the  
    landlord engaged in prohibited billing practices in deliberate  
    violation of this chapter, the penalty mentioned in the preceding  
    sentence shall be two hundred dollars, and the court shall also award  
    attorneys' fees to the tenant.  
  
        3.  No late fees or interest charges shall accrue on any disputed  
    portions of a bill while the amount is being resolved by the Hearing  
    Examiner or court, and no collection activity or unlawful detainer  
    action alleging default in the payment of rent related to the disputed  
    portions of a bill may be instituted against a tenant that has filed a  
    complaint with the Hearing Examiner or instituted a civil action in  
    accordance with this chapter while the amount is being resolved by the  
    Hearing Examiner or court.  If the Hearing Examiner or court resolves  
    the dispute and finds that a tenant that has not acted in good faith  
    in asserting a billing dispute, the Hearing Examiner or court may  
    order the tenant to pay late fees and/or interest charges on some or  
    all of the disputed portions of the bill.  
  
        4.  A landlord shall not pass on, charge, or otherwise allocate to  
    tenants, in any manner whatsoever, any damages, fine or penalty  
    (including attorneys' fees) that the landlord is ordered to pay under  
    this chapter.  
  
      C.  The existence of an unresolved or pending billing dispute does  
    not relieve a tenant of its obligation to pay in a timely fashion all  
    undisputed charges, including those undisputed charges that accrue  
    after the dispute resolution procedures of this chapter have been  
    invoked.  
  
    Section 2.  In consultation with Seattle Public Utilities, the

    of submetering, including allowing use of only certain approved meters  
    or metering technologies, establishing minimal operational standards  
    for meters, and requiring regular testing of all installed meters.
