    ATTACHMENT A:  Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project Settlement  
  
    SCHULTZ-ECHO LAKE TRANSMISSION LINE PROJECT  
  
    SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  
  
    DATE:  Effective ___________, 2003  
  
    This Settlement Agreement (Agreement) is made by and between the CITY  
    OF SEATTLE (the City), a Washington municipal corporation, and THE  
    BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION (BPA).  It establishes the  
    understanding between the City and BPA (the Parties) regarding the  
    terms under which BPA will be granted an easement across the Cedar  
    River Municipal Watershed to construct, operate and maintain its  
    Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project, formerly known as the  
    Kangley-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project, and operate and maintain  
    its existing Raver-Echo Lake transmission line through the Watershed.  
  
    RECITALS  
  
    A.  The City is a municipal corporation in the state of Washington.  
    The City owns the approximately 90,000 acre Cedar River Watershed (the  
    Watershed), which is a source for unfiltered drinking water to over  
    1.3 million people in the Puget Sound region.  
  
    B.  BPA is a power-marketing agency within the United States  
    Department of Energy.  BPA is required to ensure that its transmission  
    system can reliably serve customer needs under all operating  
    conditions, including times of peak use.  
  
    C.  BPA currently owns, operates and maintains an existing  
    transmission line that runs five miles on a 150-foot wide right of way  
    through the Watershed, the 500-kV line between Raver and Echo Lake  
    substations (the Raver-Echo Lake line).  The Raver-Echo Lake line was  
    originally constructed in 1968.  BPA now seeks an easement for a  
    transmission line right of way and associated access and service roads  
    for an additional new single-circuit 500-kilovolt (kV) transmission  
    line parallel and immediately adjacent to the Raver-Echo Lake 500-kV  
    line through the Watershed.  This proposed new line will extend a  
    total of approximately 9 miles from a tap point on BPA's Schultz-Raver  
    No. 2 500-kV line near Kangley, Washington, to BPA's Echo Lake  
    Substation near North Bend, Washington. It will be known upon  
    completion as the Schultz-Echo Lake transmission line.  Because a  
    portion of this new line will run through the Watershed, BPA requires  
    an additional adjacent 150-foot wide right of way for five miles  
    within the Watershed or about 90 acres.  
  
    D.  Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), BPA has  
    completed its Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Schultz-  
    Echo Lake Transmission Line Project (formerly known as the Kangley-  
    Echo Lake Transmission Line Project) addressing the acquisition,  
    construction and management of the Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission Line  
    Project.  
  
    E.  BPA has prepared detailed plans for the construction of the  
    Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project, including a Technical  
    Specification Package, a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP),  
    a Mitigation Action Plan (MAP), an Access Road Summary, a Clearing  
    Plan and a Maintenance Agreement for BPA Facilities in the Cedar River  
    Municipal Watershed.  (Exhibits A through F respectively.)  
  
    F. In 2000, the City, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and  
    NOAA Fisheries (formerly National Marine Fisheries Service ), through  
    considerable public input, developed and agreed to the implementation  
    of the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for  
    protection of fish and wildlife, including threatened and endangered  
    species.  The HCP covers the City's activities within the Watershed  
    and provides required Endangered Species Act (ESA) authorization for  
    certain covered activities.  NOAA Fisheries and the USFWS have  
    determined that the new Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project  
    will not adversely affect listed fish or jeopardize listed terrestrial  
    species or adversely affect their designated critical habitat.  The  
    USFWS Biological Opinion  and NOAA Fisheries Section 7 Concurrence  
    Letter related to the Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project are  
    attached hereto as Exhibits G and H, respectively.  
  
    G. Pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, BPA will control,  
    manage and minimize the effects of the new and existing transmission  
    lines on fish, wildlife, and water quality, and will provide  
    compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts.  BPA agrees and  
    covenants that it is prohibited from constructing any additional  
    transmission lines or clearing additional rights of way outside of the  
    existing Raver-Echo Lake Transmission Line right of way and the new  
    Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission Line right of way through the Watershed  
    and will not seek to condemn at any time in the future any additional  
    property in the Watershed.  As a result, this Agreement will provide a  
    significant net environmental benefit to the Watershed, even with the  
    construction, operation, and maintenance of the Schultz-Echo Lake  
    Transmission Line.  The Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission Project will  
    also provide electrical benefits to the City and the region.  
  
    H. BPA asserts that it has the authority to condemn property that is  
    reasonably necessary for the construction and operation of its  
    transmission lines, including the Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission Line.  
    However, through this Agreement the Parties intend to avoid  
    condemnation.  The Parties further agree that the total compensation  
    and other consideration flowing to the City from BPA, pursuant to this  
    Agreement, meets or exceeds the fair market value of the property that  
    BPA will use for the portion of the Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission  
    Line Project in the Watershed.  
  
    AGREEMENT  
  
    In consideration of their mutual promises and commitments, the Parties  
    hereby mutually agree as follows:  
  
    I. DEFINITIONS  
  
    For purposes of this Agreement, "the Project" consists of all BPA-  
    owned facilities within the Watershed related to the Schultz-Echo Lake  
    Transmission Line Project, including towers, conductors, communication  
    facilities, service roads, and associated right-of-way and the  
    maintenance thereof.  Also included in "the Project" are the  
    mitigation and compensation actions provided for under Section III of  
    the Agreement and management activities under Section IV.  
  
    For the purposes of this Agreement the phrase "life of the Project"  
    means the period of time, beginning with the commencement of  
    construction, that the Project continues to be constructed and  
    utilized by BPA (or its successor) for power transmission purposes.  
  
    For the purposes of this Agreement "Service Roads" and "Access Roads"  
    mean those roads that are designated as such in Exhibit I-2 attached  
    hereto.  
  
    II. TRANSMISSION RIGHT OF WAY  
  
    1. Conveyance of Easement for Right of Way and Associated Roads  
  
    In exchange for BPA's commitments as set forth in this Agreement and  
    its Exhibits, which are hereby incorporated herein by this reference,  
    the City agrees to grant and convey to BPA a perpetual easement for a  
    right of way for both the new Schultz-Echo Lake transmission line, and  
    the existing Raver-Echo Lake transmission line, all as more fully  
    described in Exhibit I.  (This easement provides BPA an additional  
    150-foot-wide transmission line right of way through the Watershed  
    along the east side of and immediately adjacent to the existing right  
    of way for the Raver-Echo Lake transmission line for a total width of  
    300 feet.  The one exception to this 150 foot wide right of way  
    expansion is on either side of the Cedar River, where BPA has agreed  
    to use double circuit towers and use only the existing 150-foot right  
    of way.)  
  
    Said easement shall also provide for construction, maintenance and use  
    by BPA of certain Access Roads and Service Roads within the Watershed  
    associated with both the new Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission line and  
    the existing Raver-Echo Lake transmission line, all as more fully  
    described in Exhibit I-2.  
  
    Said easement shall be subject to the terms, reservations and  
    conditions specified in Exhibit I, as well as the terms and conditions  
    of this Agreement and its other exhibits.  
  
    2. Novation of Existing Easement  
  
    The Parties intend to integrate the management and maintenance of the  
    existing Raver-Echo Lake Transmission Line with the new Schulz Echo  
    Lake Line, so that the two transmission lines and their associated  
    Service Roads shall be managed and maintained under a single set of  
    maintenance and management plans.  Thus, upon execution of this  
    Agreement and the referenced new easement, the Parties' rights and  
    obligations under the existing easements recorded on June 14, 1967  
    under King County Recording No. 6189299 and on September 19, 1967,  
    under King County Recording No. 6236299, shall terminate, and shall be  
    superseded by the rights and obligations described in this Agreement,  
    and Exhibit I.  
  
    3. Timber Clearing  
  
    BPA shall have the right to clear vegetation/trees consistent with the  
    Technical Specification Package and the Clearing Plan attached hereto  
    as Exhibits A and E, respectively, to allow for construction and the  
    safe and reliable operation of the new Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission  
    line.  BPA shall pay all costs associated with carrying out the  
    clearing activities specified in the Clearing Plan, including but not  
    limited to transporting timber designated in the Clearing Plan for  
    removal to sites specified in the Clearing Plan.  The City shall be  
    entitled to all revenues (i.e. gross revenues) that may be derived  
    from the sale of any timber removed from the Watershed, provided that  
    the City shall use these revenues to fund Watershed enhancement  
    projects through the dedicated account and procedures established in  
    Section III(2) of this Agreement.  
  
    4. Public Access  
  
    Nothing in this Agreement creates a right of public access.  The City  
    retains the authority to regulate access in a manner that protects its  
    public drinking-water supply, minimizes adverse impacts to fish and  
    wildlife and their habitat, and otherwise maintains the natural  
    resource values for which the Watershed is managed.  Nothing in this  
    Agreement limits the authority or ability of the City to manage the  
    Watershed for public safety and fish and wildlife habitat  
    conservation, or to preserve and protect cultural, historic, and  
    religious sites.  BPA agrees that it will observe the City's Watershed  
    Access Water Quality and Control Regulations (Exhibit I-3) during the  
    life of the Project.  BPA may take reasonable additional measures to  
    protect BPA-owned facilities within the Watershed.  
  
    5. Right of Way Use, Abandonment,  Limitation on Expansion and  
    Upgrade, and Prohibition of Future Condemnation  
  
    The City shall have rights of access to the BPA right of way and  
    Service Roads as described in Exhibit I for all uses not inconsistent  
    with the BPA's easement rights.  
  
    If BPA abandons, or ceases to use, the transmission lines, the  
    easement and right of way granted pursuant to this Agreement shall  
    revert to the City.  
  
    BPA covenants and agrees that it will not seek to expand the size of  
    any existing transmission line right of way and/or roads in the  
    Watershed (beyond the expansion provided for in this Agreement) and  
    that it will not propose or construct any additional right of way or  
    seek to acquire any additional easement or property interest through  
    or within the Watershed.  However, BPA will be allowed to seek  
    upgrades to existing lines and the installation of new equipment  
    (which may include replacing the existing Raver-Echo Lake and/or the  
    new Schultz-Echo Lake line with single circuit towers or double  
    circuit towers and fiber wires attached to transmission towers) so  
    long as such upgrades or such installations do not have significant  
    environmental or water quality impacts.  For the purposes of this  
    provision, the term "significant environmental impact" shall be  
    construed in accordance with NEPA and the Washington State  
    Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and their implementing regulations.  
    Any upgrades or replacement work shall be subject to the terms and  
    conditions of this Agreement to the extent applicable.  BPA represents  
    that there are currently no plans to upgrade the lines and BPA's  
    studies have indicated no need for another transmission or fiber line  
    through the Watershed beyond those described in this Agreement.  Any  
    proposed upgrades or installation of new equipment shall be subject to  
    the federal NEPA process and the City's prior review and approval.  
    The City's approval of proposed upgrades and installations shall not  
    be unreasonably withheld but may be withheld if the proposed upgrade  
    or installation is likely to have any significant environmental or  
    water quality impacts.  BPA may also upgrade roads for purposes of  
    regulatory compliance, subject to the review and approval by the City,  
    which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
  
    BPA further covenants and agrees that it will not now, or in the  
    future, seek to condemn, nor support other party's condemnation, of  
    any additional properties, easements, or rights of way within the  
    Watershed.  
  
    III. MITIGATION/COMPENSATION  
  
    The Parties agree that the fulfillment of the promises and commitments  
    set forth in this Agreement constitute full and adequate mitigation  
    for all potential Project impacts in the Watershed and that the City  
    is receiving adequate compensation for the new rights granted to BPA  
    for the Project.  
  
    1. Transfer of Certain Properties to the City of Seattle  
  
    In consideration of the rights granted to BPA under this Agreement and  
    to help offset unavoidable impacts of the Project, BPA shall arrange  
    for the transfer to the City of certain property in King County,  
    Washington, adjacent to the Watershed as follows:  
  
    a) Portions of the South half of Section 26, Township 23 North, Range  
    7 East, W.M. (the "Trillium Property"), as more fully described in  
    Exhibit J, and consisting of approximately 110 acres.  Approximately  
    60 acres of the Trillium Property are covered with second or third  
    growth coniferous forest trees.  The remainder of the Property has 10-  
    year-old trees, and the Property includes approximately 4.6 acres of  
    wetlands.  The Trillium Property will be conveyed by BPA to the City  
    via a quitclaim deed with title insurance purchased at BPA expense.  
    Upon conveyance of the Trillium Property to the City by BPA, BPA shall  
    reserve a conservation easement on the on the Property in  
    substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit K.  BPA shall also  
    reserve a transmission line easement for the purpose of providing a  
    300 wide line right of way for BPA's transmission lines where they  
    cross the SE 1/4 of Section 26, which reserved transmission line  
    easement shall, insofar as applicable, be subject to the terms and  
    conditions as the easement set forth in Exhibit I of this Agreement.  
    BPA will convey the Trillium Property to the City not later than 90  
    days after the effective date of this Agreement.  
  
    b) That portion of Section 25, Township 22 north, Range 7 West, W.M.  
    north of the northern boundary of the existing BPA right of way  
    through said Section (the "Selleck Property"), consisting of  
    approximately 363 acres, 30 acres of which contain mature trees and  
    the remaining acres containing trees that are approximately 10 years  
    old.  This property also has a creek and approximately 80 acres of  
    wetlands.  BPA shall retain a conservation easement on this property  
    substantially similar to the conservation easement attached hereto as  
    Exhibit K.  BPA will arrange for the conveyance of the Selleck  
    Property to the City to occur not later than one year after the  
    effective date of this Agreement.  BPA shall make best efforts to  
    arrange for the transfer of the Selleck Property to the City under a  
    statutory warranty deed.  BPA shall transfer the property with title  
    insurance purchased at BPA's expense.  
  
    c) That portion of Section 5, Township 21 North, Range 11 East, W.M.,  
    bounded on the west by the City's ownership and on the north, east and  
    south by the Cedar River Watershed's hydrographic boundary (the  
    "Yakima Pass Property"), consisting of approximately 100 acres, almost  
    all of which is covered with trees that are approximately 30 years  
    old.  A three-acre lake (Twilight Lake) is located within the  
    Property.  In order to pursue this acquisition, BPA will make its best  
    efforts to obtain an agreement with the US Forest Service enabling BPA  
    to convey the Yakima Pass Property to the City not later than three  
    years after the effective date of this Agreement.  Because BPA is not  
    assured this property can be acquired, it will place $150,000 (the  
    approximate value of the property) in an interest bearing escrow  
    account.  If a period of three years has passed since the execution of  
    this Agreement without conveyance of the Yakima Pass property to the  
    City, then the City may, at its discretion, extend the conveyance  
    deadline for a period of up to one year.  If BPA is not able to  
    arrange such transfer under a statutory warranty deed, BPA shall  
    transfer the property with title insurance purchased at BPA's expense.  
    If, despite its best efforts, BPA is unable to acquire the Yakima Pass  
    Property, then the escrowed funds shall be provided to the City for  
    acquisition of other suitable property(ies) at the City's sole  
    discretion.  
  
    The City will  manage the referenced properties  under its present and  
    future watershed management policies.  
  
    2. Monetary Compensation for Watershed Enhancement  
  
    In partial consideration for the right to construct and maintain the  
    new Shultz-Echo Lake Transmission Line through the Watershed, BPA  
    shall, in addition to the other compensation and reimbursement  
    provided for under this Agreement, pay the City the sum of $6,000,000  
    (Six Million Dollars).  This payment shall be made in two installments  
    of $3,000,000, the first to be made on or before October 30, 2003 or  
    the commencement of construction, whichever is later, and the second  
    to be made on or before October 30, 2004 which second payment may be  
    delayed only in the event and to the extent that the City unreasonably  
    causes delay in completion of construction.  Such payments shall be  
    used by the City to provide increased funding for the following  
    programs and projects:  
  
    * Enhancement and acceleration of the City's Road Improvement and  
    Abandonment within the Watershed (including the removal of existing  
    roads in the "Foothills" property in the South half of Section 23,  
    Township 22 North, Range 7 East W.M..) to compensate and offset the  
    effects of the additional road length added to the Watershed as a  
    result of the Project;  
  
    * Expansion and acceleration of the City's Upland Forest Restoration  
    Program in the Watershed to help compensate for the loss of older  
    second-growth forest habitat within the Watershed and the loss of  
    future forest growth potential within the right of way area;  
  
    * Enhancement and acceleration of the City's Watershed Riparian and  
    Aquatic Restoration Program, to help compensate for the impacts to the  
    riparian, stream and wetland habitat areas within the Watershed;  
  
    * The purchase and installation of Watershed Security improvements to  
    help restrict Watershed access.  The City shall submit its plans for  
    such improvements to BPA for review and comment prior to beginning  
    such work.  
  
    The City shall direct the six million dollars provided for in this  
    Section to the Water Fund of Seattle Public Utilities, to be earmarked  
    within that Fund for the categories of activities specified in this  
    Subsection III(2) and the City's share of Water Quality Monitoring  
    activities specified in Subsection III(5) of this Section.  Allocation  
    of the funds to specific activities shall be at the sole discretion of  
    the City; provided, however, that the City shall give BPA prior notice  
    and the opportunity to comment upon such allocation.  The City shall  
    include a description of the annual use of the funds in its HCP Annual  
    Report, which shall be provided to BPA.  
  
    3. Compensation for Right Of Way Management  
  
    The City and BPA intend to manage vegetation and water resources in  
    the combined right of way in ways that are compatible with the City's  
    HCP and land management policies.  To meet this objective, BPA will  
    develop, subject to City review and approval, right of way vegetation  
    maintenance prescriptions consistent with the requirements specified  
    in the Maintenance Agreement for BPA Facilities in the Cedar River  
    Municipal Watershed  (Exhibit F) that prescribe the desired standards,  
    actions, and implementation schedule over the life of the Project and  
    specify which maintenance actions shall be completed by BPA and which  
    shall be completed by the City, subject to BPA reimbursement.  BPA  
    shall be responsible for the cost of implementing all the prescribed  
    maintenance actions.  To assist the City in actively participating in  
    the design and development of vegetation maintenance standards and  
    actions, City involvement in prescription development shall be  
    reimbursed by BPA pursuant Section IV (3) of this Agreement.  
  
    4. Compensation for Road Maintenance  
  
    The City actively and routinely maintains the road system in the  
    Watershed, applying standards that typically meet or exceed the road  
    standards used by BPA for normal operation and maintenance of  
    transmission lines.  The City shall maintain the Access Roads, as well  
    as the Service Roads.  The City shall develop and implement, subject  
    to BPA review and approval, road maintenance prescriptions consistent  
    with the requirements specified in the Maintenance Agreement for BPA  
    Facilities in the Cedar River Municipal Watershed (Exhibit F) that  
    describe the standards and the prescribed maintenance schedule that  
    will be used over the life of the Project.  BPA shall reimburse the  
    City annually, for the life of the project, for all City costs  
    associated with maintenance of the Service Roads, and for BPA's  
    proportionate share (based upon BPA's proportionate use) of the costs  
    associated with maintenance of the Access Roads.  The road maintenance  
    prescriptions may be amended from time to time.  
  
    5. Compensation  for Watershed Water Quality Monitoring  
  
    BPA acknowledges that water quality in streams and other water bodies  
    in the vicinity of the Project (upstream and downstream) should be  
    closely monitored such that any pollution events (including  
    sedimentation) that may arise from BPA's construction and operation  
    activities can be identified and addressed in a timely manner.  BPA  
    shall design and implement, prior to the commencement of any  
    construction activities (including but not limited to clearing) within  
    the Watershed, a water turbidity monitoring system, subject to  
    approval by the City.  Ownership, operation, and maintenance of the  
    water turbidity monitoring system shall be BPA's responsibility for a  
    period of three years after installation.  At the end of that three  
    year period, ownership of the system shall be transferred to the City,  
    which will then operate and maintain the system at its discretion, and  
    may fund such operation and maintenance from the earmarked funds  
    provided under Subsection III(2) of this Agreement.  
  
    IV. MITIGATION AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE RIGHT OF WAY  
  
    As provided below and in the Exhibits attached to this Agreement, BPA  
    has agreed to implement a number of innovative construction and  
    management activities in the right of way to minimize potential  
    adverse environmental impacts.  These include: using micro-pile  
    footings which reduce soil disturbance; installing two double circuit  
    transmission towers for the Cedar River crossing which eliminates a  
    need to clear vegetation within 700 feet of the river; using  
    helicopter construction for placement of all towers (except the double  
    circuit towers) and helicopter transport for cut trees to minimize  
    soil disturbance; avoiding construction in wetlands; limiting ground-  
    disturbing activities to the dry season; and providing an independent  
    environmental monitor with stop-work authority.  Right of way  
    management practices addressed in this Agreement and its Exhibits  
    include making existing roads within wetlands impassable; minimizing  
    new road construction; allowing low to medium growing vegetation  
    within the right of way; minimizing clearing for construction and  
    maintenance at river and creek crossings; clearing tall growing  
    species on a rotation basis so that more tall trees are available for  
    longer periods and provide a variety of vegetation heights;  
    suppressing non-native species and seeding/planting native species;  
    and continuing not to use herbicides in the watershed.  
  
    The following provisions shall apply to the entire right of way,  
    including the portions occupied by the existing Raver-Echo Lake  
    transmission line and the new Schultz-Echo Lake transmission line.  
  
    1. Overall Mitigation and Best Management Practices Commitments  
  
    BPA, as owner and operator of the new Schultz-Echo Lake and the  
    existing Raver-Echo Lake transmission line shall have ongoing  
    responsibility to construct, operate and maintain the lines and towers  
    in good working condition for the life of the Project, and to ensure  
    that the Project facilities meet applicable laws and regulations.  The  
    Technical Specifications Package, the Stormwater Pollution Prevention  
    Plan (SWPPP), the Mitigation Action Plan (MAP), the Access Road  
    Summary, the Clearing Plan and the Maintenance Agreement for BPA  
    Facilities in the Cedar River Municipal Watershed attached hereto as  
    Exhibits A through F, respectively shall establish the minimum  
    standards for construction and operation of the Project and BPA shall  
    comply with all such standards as applicable.  In addition, BPA shall  
    continue to monitor various aspects of the Project, as specified in  
    its MAP.  When the monitoring activities identify adverse  
  
    environmental impacts occurring on the Project site caused by BPA, BPA  
    shall, with the City's consent and approval, undertake practicable  
    mitigation action(s) at BPA's expense to minimize such impacts, and  
    shall comply with any applicable federal or state environmental law or  
    regulation.  
  
    Prior to commencement of any construction activity in the Watershed,  
    BPA shall contract with an independent environmental inspector who  
    will have authority to stop BPA construction activity (including  
    clearing) within the Watershed.  The environmental inspector shall not  
    be an employee of BPA, the City, or BPA's construction contractor.  
    The individual contracted to perform the function of the environmental  
    inspector shall be selected by BPA, subject to approval by the City,  
    and shall have appropriate experience and training in monitoring  
    environmental compliance and familiarity with applicable drinking  
    water quality regulations.  The environmental inspector shall monitor  
    BPA construction activities within the Watershed and have the  
    authority to stop any construction activities that are or could  
    potentially degrade water quality in Rock Creek and/or the Cedar  
    River, or could create any unauthorized wetland fill.  The  
    environmental inspector shall inspect and monitor all best management  
    practices (BMPs) to ensure they are implemented and/or installed and  
    functioning properly.  The environmental inspector shall report any  
    concerns or actions to be taken to correct any water quality or other  
    environmental concerns to the BPA Contract Officer or Technical  
    Representative (COTR) and to the City's designated representative.  
    The BPA COTR shall immediately initiate the environmental inspector's  
    specified corrective actions including stop work orders.  In the event  
    a stop work order is issued to the BPA COTR by the environmental  
    inspector, project work (other than remediation work) at the specific  
    site in question shall not be restarted without prior approval by the  
    environmental inspector in consultation with the City.  In the event  
    of any failure on the part of BPA or its contractor to comply with the  
    provisions of this subsection the City may seek immediate injunctive  
    relief without regard to the alternative dispute resolution provision  
    or the "right to cure" provision of this Agreement.  
  
    BPA also covenants and agrees to act as a good steward of the  
    environment.  If a potential significant impact on the environment  
    caused by BPA's construction or operation of the Project is  
    identified, BPA shall undertake necessary mitigation, and when  
    appropriate, prepare NEPA documents and obtain required permits and  
    approvals.  The Maintenance Agreement for BPA Facilities in the Cedar  
    River Municipal Watershed (Exhibit F) specifies the reporting  
    processes and periodic meetings by which the Parties will communicate  
    issues/concerns and maintenance schedules for the transmission line  
    right of way and Service Roads.  
  
    2. Management Activities and Maintenance Agreement for BPA Facilities  
    in the Cedar River Municipal Watershed  
  
    BPA shall undertake only those management activities that are included  
    in the Technical Specifications Package for the Project and/or the  
    Maintenance Agreement for BPA Facilities in the Cedar River Municipal  
    Watershed, Exhibits A and F respectively, except as mutually agreed in  
    writing by the Parties.  
  
    3. Reimbursement for City Project Oversight  
  
    BPA shall reimburse the City for costs incurred by the City in  
    connection with the construction phase of the Project, including such  
    activities as construction oversight.  The City shall perform its  
    oversight activities efficiently.  
  
    4. Cultural Resources  
  
    BPA will integrate management planning for historic and cultural  
    resources, as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act and  
    any applicable state law, with its construction and operation  
    practices as a means of avoiding impacts to cultural and historic  
    resources.  This planning will provide for avoidance of impacts to  
    cultural resources and, where appropriate, mitigation for impacts to  
    historic properties.  
  
    5. Endangered Species Act  
  
    When project construction, operation, or maintenance activities have  
    the potential to affect species listed under the federal Endangered  
    Species Act, BPA shall not proceed with those actions/activities until  
    the completion of requisite consultations, conferences, or acquisition  
    of necessary permits.  Upon written request, the City shall make  
    available for inspection, and copying at BPA's expense, records  
    subject to disclosure under the Washington Public Disclosure Act that  
    it has for such consultations, conferences, or acquisition of permits.  
  
    6. Responsibility for Compliance with Applicable Law  
  
    It shall be BPA's sole responsibility to assure that the construction  
    and operation of the Project complies with all applicable state, local  
    and federal law.  
  
    V. ADDITIONAL BPA ASSURANCES  
  
    1. Third-Party Indemnification and Hold Harmless  
  
    BPA shall hold harmless and indemnify the City and its employees,  
    officers, and agents from and against all losses and liability arising  
    out of injury to other third persons or their property arising from  
    BPA's construction, maintenance, or operation of the Schultz-Echo Lake  
    transmission line, to the full extent permitted by federal law, except  
    to the extent such injury results from actions or inactions by the  
    City, its employees, officers, and agents.  "To the full extent  
    permitted by federal law" means that BPA's duty to indemnify and hold  
    harmless the City against third-party actions under this provision is:  
    a) limited to that liability that would arise by operation or  
    violation of a federal law (primarily but not limited to the Federal  
    Tort Claims Act, the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Endangered  
    Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the National Environmental  
    Policy Act ), and not because of any provision or language in this  
    Agreement; and b) limited by BPA annual budget amounts for the  
    applicable transmission budget item at the time of loss, with no  
    implication that additional funds will be approved to make up any  
    difference.  "The applicable transmission budget item" means the  
    Upgrades and Additions line item in the BPA Capital budget or the  
    Operations and Maintenance line item within the BPA Operations budget  
    in the current President's budget submittal, or comparable provisions  
    if these budget items are modified in the future.  As a result, this  
    provision does not create an independent contractual obligation to  
    indemnify the City.  This provision does not limit the enforceability  
    of the other provisions of this Agreement, or the scope or  
    enforceability of the insurance coverage provided for in Subsection  
    V(3) of this Section.  
  
    If the City is sued for injuries to third persons or property arising  
    from BPA's construction, maintenance, or operation of the Schultz-Echo  
    Lake transmission line and there is not liability under federal law,  
    BPA will nevertheless cooperate fully with the City in its legal  
    defense.  
  
    2. Assurances Regarding Water Quality  
  
    BPA acknowledges that it is undertaking construction of the Project in  
    a protected watershed that serves as a source of unfiltered drinking  
    water to over 1.3 million people in the Puget Sound area.  BPA further  
    acknowledges that the Cedar River Watershed is a unique and highly  
    sensitive habitat area for numerous species of fish and wildlife, some  
    of which are listed as threatened or endangered under federal or state  
    law, and that a Habitat Conservation Plan has been established,  
    pursuant to section 10 of the Endangered Species Act, within the  
    Watershed.  
  
    BPA acknowledges and agrees that its decision to construct the  
    transmission line in the Cedar River Watershed carries with it a  
    special obligation on the part of BPA to take extraordinary steps  
    during construction, operation, and maintenance of the line to protect  
    the drinking-water supply source and to mitigate impacts construction  
    or operation of the Project has on fish and wildlife habitat.  
  
    BPA accepts responsibility and liability, whether now existing or  
    arising in the future, for any discharge or runoff of pollutants  
    (including but not limited to soil and particulates that may cause a  
    turbidity event) from the construction, operation, or maintenance of  
    the Project into the Cedar River or its tributaries.  Further, BPA  
    shall be subject to and comply with all federal, state, interstate,  
    and local requirements, administrative authority, and process and  
    sanctions respecting the control and abatement of water pollution in  
    the same manner and to the same extent as any non-governmental entity,  
    as set forth in 33 U.S.C. 1323 and 33 USC 1344(t), as amended.  
  
    3. Insurance  
  
    In light of these special obligations, BPA agrees that, prior to  
    commencement of any construction work by BPA in the Watershed  
    (including clearing), it shall procure an environmental insurance  
    policy, on which the City shall be an insured entity, in substantially  
    the form attached hereto as Exhibit L.  In general, the insurance  
    policy will provide coverage for a broad range of losses that either  
    insured becomes legally obligated to pay as a result of a claim for  
    bodily injury, property damage or environmental damage caused by a  
    pollution incident resulting from covered operations, provided such  
    claim is first made against the insured and reported to the insurance  
    carrier in writing during the policy period (or extended reporting  
    period).  Covered operations consist of construction, operation and  
    maintenance of the power transmission line, including: clearing of the  
    new right of way, construction and improvement of access roads,  
    removal and replacement of culverts, road abandonment; and  
    construction of steel lattice structures with foundations, conductors,  
    fiber optics, and grounding.  Environmental mitigation requirements  
    are also included.  The insurance policy terms and conditions will  
    establish the breadth of insured liabilities and losses and any  
    exclusions that apply.  BPA is solely responsible for, and agrees  
    to pay, any and all deductibles under the insurance policy.  
  
    In addition to the above pollution policy, BPA shall also require the  
    general contractor on the Project to purchase and maintain general  
    liability insurance with limits of $5 million per occurrence, and $10  
    million per occurrence for aircraft liability and naming the City as  
    an additional insured.  
  
    All of the above referenced policies shall be endorsed to provide a  
    waiver of any subrogation rights the insurer might otherwise have for  
    claims against the City or its employees or agents.  
  
    4. Assurances Regarding Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation  
    Plan  
  
    BPA acknowledges and agrees that the City has a fundamental interest  
    that the Cedar River Watershed Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP),  
    established in 2000, remain intact and unaffected by the construction,  
    operation and maintenance of the new Schultz-Echo Lake line and  
    associated access roads pursuant to this Agreement.  Accordingly, the  
    BPA has obtained assurances from NOAA Fisheries (Exhibit M) and USFWS  
    (Exhibit N) that construction and operation of the Project is  
    compatible with and will not affect the City's Incidental Take Permit  
    coverage under the HCP.  
  
    Further, to assure that the City's interests under the HCP are fully  
    protected, BPA agrees that, in addition to all other compensation and  
    assurances provided for in this Agreement, it will pay up to  $10  
    million toward any additional mitigation requirements that may be  
    imposed upon the City as a result of the Project in order for the City  
    to continue to be covered by its Incidental Take Permits issued by  
    NOAA Fisheries and USFWS in connection with the HCP.  BPA shall make  
    such payment for such mitigation ordered by a court of competent  
    jurisdiction or imposed administratively by any federal agency of  
    competent jurisdiction, including NOAA Fisheries or USFWS, as an  
    additional Incidental Take Permit condition, but only to the extent  
    such order or administrative requirement is a result of the  
    construction and/or operation of the Project.  These funds shall be  
    available for such payment for any such order based on claims or  
    circumstances arising within a period of 7 years following the date of  
    this Agreement.  Payment from the fund shall also be made by BPA for  
    any attorney fees the City is obligated to pay to any third parties as  
    a result of an action against the City relating to BPA's construction  
    or operation of the Project, to the extent such obligation is caused  
    by BPA's actions or failure to act and not covered by insurance.  
  
    5. Right to Cure  
  
    Where a violation of law, court order, or regulatory agency order can  
    be "cured" and where imminent threat to public safety or health is not  
    present, BPA, and the insurance company, if the insurance policy is  
    still in effect, shall be given a 60-day period to cure the purported  
    non-compliance or violation.  Such right to cure shall not relieve BPA  
    or the insurance company from liability for damages or injury incurred  
    during the "cure" period which damages or injury have not been fully  
    remedied by BPA's or the insurance company's cure, and which they  
    would otherwise be responsible for under this Agreement or the  
    applicable insurance policy.  If reasonable progress has been made in  
    the first 60 days and the Parties mutually agree, the period to cure  
    can be extended to a mutually agreed period of time.  
  
    6. Dispute Resolution  
  
    In the event of a dispute as to causation or any other matter related  
    to this Agreement, the parties shall meet at least once to attempt  
    amicable settlement through non-binding mediation.  The mediation  
    session shall be led by a single mediator, agreed to by both parties,  
    and with each party paying its own costs, attorney fees, and half of  
    all mediation costs.  The mediation shall continue so long as both  
    parties are agreeable.  There will be no discovery for the mediation.  
  
    VI. GENERAL OBLIGATIONS  
  
    1. Limited Alternative to Filtration (LAF) Approval  
  
    Prior to the issuance of a Record of Decision (ROD) by BPA in  
    connection with the Schultz-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project, the  
    City of Seattle has submitted to the Washington Department of Health  
    (DOH) a proposed revision to the Cedar River Watershed Control Plan  
    consisting of BPA's Technical Specifications Package for the Schultz-  
    Echo Lake Transmission Line Project together with a draft and a  
    summary of this Agreement.  BPA's right to commence right of way  
    clearing or other construction activities within the Watershed under  
    this Agreement is contingent upon written confirmation from DOH that  
    implementation of the Project pursuant to the Technical Specifications  
    Package and the terms of this Agreement will not adversely affect the  
    City's eligibility for LAF approval by DOH in accordance with the  
    January 14, 2002 Memorandum of Agreement between the Environmental  
    Protection Agency (EPA) and the Washington State Department of Health,  
    which concerns the Limited Alternative to Filtration (LAF) standards  
    for the Seattle Cedar River Supply.  
  
    2. SEPA Compliance  
  
    The City has adopted BPA's environmental impact statement and public  
    process in lieu of a separate SEPA environmental review process.  
  
    3. Right to Inspect  
  
    The City shall, after reasonable notice to BPA, have the opportunity  
    to inspect the Project, to monitor BPA's compliance with this  
    Agreement and to enforce its terms.  In the event the City identifies  
    non-compliance with a stated obligation or has another reason for  
    dissatisfaction, the City shall promptly notify BPA.  If appropriate,  
    BPA or the insurance company will be given an opportunity to cure the  
    problem, as provided in Subsection V(5)  
  
    VII. MISCELLANEOUS CLAUSES  
  
    1. Binding Effect  
  
    This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the

    EXHIBIT F  
  
    MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT FOR BPA FACILITIES IN THE CEDAR RIVER MUNICIPAL  
    WATERSHED  
  
    1.0 INTRODUCTION  
  
    This Maintenance Agreement is Exhibit F to the Schultz-Echo Lake  
    Transmission Line Project Settlement Agreement (Settlement Agreement)  
    between Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and the City of Seattle  
    (City).  As such, this Maintenance Agreement will become effective  
    only after:  
  
    1) BPA has issued its Final Environmental Impact Statement and NEPA  
    Record of Decision for the Kangley-Echo Lake 500-kilovolt Transmission  
    Line Project and BPA has identified Alternative #1 as the selected  
    alternative; and  
  
    2) The City Council of the City has approved the Settlement Agreement  
    and both parties have signed the Settlement Agreement.  
  
    If any provision of this Maintenance Agreement conflicts with any  
    provision of the Settlement Agreement, the terms of the Settlement  
    Agreement shall take precedence in that case.  A sample right-of-way  
    vegetation report called "Operational Silvicultural Prescription" is  
    attached as Appendix A to this Maintenance Agreement as an example of  
    what such prescriptions (referenced in this Exhibit) could resemble.  
  
    1.1 Scope  
  
    As part of the Settlement Agreement, BPA and the City enter into this  
    Maintenance Agreement addressing vegetation and facilities located  
    within easements for right-of-way (ROW) and roads that the City has  
    granted to BPA within the Cedar River Municipal Watershed (CRMW).  
    Those easements, described in the Settlement Agreement and its  
    Exhibits, are for transmission ROW, Service Roads, and Access Roads  
    for both the Raver-Monroe 500-kV and the Schultz-Echo Lake 500-kV  
    transmission lines within the CRMW.  For purposes of this Maintenance  
    Agreement, "Service Roads" and "Access Roads" mean those roads  
    designated as such in Exhibit I-2 of the Settlement Agreement.  
  
    Generally, this Maintenance Agreement addresses:  
  
    * Management of vegetation that may impede the operation and  
    maintenance of these transmission lines;  
  
    * Control and containment of noxious weed species, as identified by  
    King County Noxious Weed Board and agreed to by the City and BPA.  
  
    * Maintenance of all Service Roads and Access Roads used by BPA for  
    transmission line operation and maintenance;  
  
    * Emergency situations;  
  
    * Development and maintenance of diverse, low-growing native plant  
    communities within the transmission ROW that incorporate as much  
    structural and native biological diversity as is practicable.  
  
    This Maintenance Agreement does not apply to the Schultz-Raver  
    transmission ROW that passes through the CRMW and which corridor  
    contains multiple main-grid transmission lines.  For that ROW, BPA  
    will continue to manage tall-growing vegetation and noxious weeds  
    using its standard Integrated Vegetation Management (IVM) practices,  
    excluding the use of herbicides.  In addition, BPA will continue to  
    maintain its access roads and control access to this particular ROW.  
    BPA will continue, however, to consider the City's road and vegetation  
    management recommendations for maintenance of the Schultz-Raver  
    transmission ROW.  
  
    1.2 BPA's Management Goals  
  
    BPA uses an IVM strategy for maintaining ROW corridors.  This is a  
    cost-effective process that maximizes favorable effects and minimizes  
    potential negative effects from vegetation management methods.  The  
    ultimate goal for IVM right-of-way management is to convert the ROW to  
    a stable, low-growing native plant community that inhibits the  
    establishment of tall-growing vegetation, maintains itself with little  
    or no human intervention, and resists invasion from noxious and  
    invasive plant species.  This minimizes BPA's ROW maintenance needs  
    and environmental impacts while reducing BPA's costs in the long term.  
    The City of Seattle does not allow the use of herbicides to manage  
    vegetation in the CRMW.  Therefore, BPA agrees that its use of the IVM  
    program within the CRMW will include only non-chemical methods, unless  
    otherwise approved in advance and in writing by the City.  Without the  
    use of chemicals, the timeline to reach objectives may be increased.  
    It is also BPA's goal to work with the City to reduce  
    erosion/sedimentation, increase slope stability and biodiversity, and  
    provide habitats for a variety of species including birds, mammals,  
    fish, and invertebrates.  
  
    1.3 The City's Management Goals  
  
    The City's main goal in being a party to this Maintenance Agreement is  
    to assist BPA to develop and implement ROW maintenance that is  
    consistent with the CRMW's main function as a municipal water supply,  
    and consistent with the principles, philosophy, and requirements set  
    forth in the CRMW Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), the current  
    Watershed and resource management plan being used by the City to  
    manage the CRMW.   It is important to the City that BPA ensures BPA's  
    transmission projects and associated facilities in the CRMW avoid  
    erosion/sedimentation; increase slope stability; enhance native  
    biological diversity; and provide quality, structurally diverse  
    habitat for a variety of species including birds, mammals, fish, and  
    invertebrates.  A primary objective of ROW maintenance is to achieve  
    stable, low-growing native-dominated plant communities within the  
    transmission ROW.  These communities are expected to inhibit the  
    establishment of tall-growing vegetation, require little or no human  
    intervention, and resist invasion from noxious and invasive plant  
    species.  This objective minimizes BPA's ROW maintenance needs and  
    environmental impacts while reducing BPA's long-term maintenance  
    costs, and makes BPA's activities in the CRMW more consistent with the  
    principles and requirements of the HCP.  The City does not allow the  
    use of herbicides to manage vegetation in the CRMW.  Therefore, the  
    ROW vegetation management program for this area must use only non-  
    chemical controls, unless otherwise approved in advance and in writing  
    by the City.  
  
    2.0 GENERAL AGREEMENTS  
  
    2.1 Vegetation Management  
  
    * BPA will determine operational and safety standards (for purposes of  
    addressing liability and transmission reliability) and have the final  
    determination on ROW brush clearing requirements and BPA access road  
    maintenance requirements.  
  
    * BPA and the City will discuss and agree annually who will maintain  
    the vegetation on the ROW for the next treatment.  
  
    * Whether the work will be implemented by BPA or the City, or both  
    parties, the exact acreage and areas to be treated in any one year and  
    the specific treatment methods and standards to be used that year  
    shall be determined by field review between the City and BPA personnel  
    before any work commences.  If BPA conducts the brush clearing and  
    tree-cutting work, BPA will coordinate with the City prior to  
    implementation.  
  
    * BPA may use the City for hand cutting, or machine-cutting/pulling to  
    remove the tall-growing and/or noxious weed species.  Due to the cost,  
    BPA will only use hand-pulling as a last resort to control noxious  
    species.  BPA will not use herbicides or biological controls, unless  
    authorized in advance in writing by the City.  
  
    * For ROW vegetation maintenance, BPA will pay the City the equivalent  
    amount of what it would have cost BPA for an equivalent ROW brush  
    clearing operation as done by contractors.  Before any payment is  
    made, the work will be inspected by BPA. The 2002 cost is  
    approximately $225/acre every three to four years (i.e., growing  
    seasons) for manual/machine clearing with no herbicide application.  
    BPA generally performs its brush control every three years in areas  
    west of the Cascades depending on site conditions and vegetation  
    growth.  This cost per acre may change with increased standards or  
    changed market rates as mutually agreed to by BPA and the City.  The  
    cost will be agreed upon during the annual workplan discussions.  
  
    * Before commencing that work mutually agreed by both parties to be  
    completed by the City, the City must provide a Site-specific Safety  
    Plan (SSSP) to BPA for approval for any tasks performed in and  
    immediately adjacent to the ROW.  The SSSP will help ensure the work  
    will be performed in a safe manner considering the potential dangers  
    posed by high voltage transmission lines.  In addition, the City will  
    provide qualified personnel for the cutting of trees or brush.  
    Appendix B describes BPA's minimum qualifications and safety  
    requirements for Contractor Employees Involved in Vegetation Control  
    on BPA Transmission ROWs.  All personnel conducting Line Clearance  
    Tree Trimming and/or Timber Harvest activities within or immediately  
    adjacent to the ROW shall adhere to OSHA 1910-269, as well as other  
    applicable rules and regulations related to work under or in the  
    vicinity of high voltage power lines such as National Electrical  
    Safety Code and BPA standards.  Any other work conducted on the ROW  
    not covered under this restriction will be considered on a case-by-  
    case basis with prior-approval from BPA (for example, plantings, weed  
    management, routine road maintenance, scientific studies, and so  
    forth).  
  
    *  BPA will prepare any required environmental documentation and/or  
    obtain required permits to meet applicable environmental laws (NEPA,  
    ESA, etc.) prior to the commencement of any transmission maintenance  
    work by BPA or the City.  As a federal agency, BPA is not required to  
    meet the sensitive area protection requirements identified by King  
    County.  However, BPA substantially complies with these standards on a  
    voluntary basis.  
  
    2.2 Access and Service Road Maintenance:  
  
    For purposes of this Maintenance Agreement, "Service Roads" and  
    "Access Roads" mean those roads designated as such in Exhibit I-2 of  
    the Settlement Agreement.  For purposes of this Maintenance Agreement  
    and the Settlement Agreement, "Service Roads" are those road segments  
    that exist for no other reason than to access BPA's transmission  
    structures and associated features.  Service Roads are typically, but  
    not always, contained within the transmission ROW.   They would not  
    exist but for the presence of BPA's facilities.  As identified in the  
    Settlement Agreement and the Grant of Easement (Settlement Agreement,  
    Exhibit I), the City reserves the rights to use these roads for  
    security, fire-suppression, research, or other access purposes.  As  
    described and depicted in Exhibit I-2, "Access Roads" are those road  
    segments that exist mainly to provide access to the City's facilities  
    and lands within the CRMW, but which are also used by BPA to access  
    its facilities and Service Roads.  
  
    Each year before maintenance work on either access or service roads  
    commences the parties will determine through a field review the road  
    segments to be maintained.  BPA and the City will also discuss and  
    agree annually who will maintain the road segments and how much the  
    work is estimated to cost.  For any BPA Service Roads, BPA will  
    prepare any required environmental documentation and/or obtain  
    required permits to meet applicable environmental laws (NEPA, ESA,  
    etc...) prior to the commencement of any work by BPA or the City.  For  
    Access Roads, the City will prepare any required environmental  
    documentation and/or obtain required permits to meet applicable  
    environmental laws (SEPA, etc...) prior to the commencement of any  
    work by BPA or the City.  
  
  
    BPA will integrate management planning for historic and cultural  
    resources, as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act and  
    any applicable state law, with its operation and maintenance  
    activities as a means to avoiding impacts to those resources.  This  
    planning will provide for avoidance of impacts to cultural resources  
    and, where appropriate, mitigation for unavoidable impacts to historic  
    properties.  BPA will coordinate with the Public & Cultural Programs  
    Manager on all proposed ground disturbing activities and emergency  
    responses to assure consistency with the Standards for Cultural  
    Resource Management provisions of the CRMW's Cultural Resource  
    Management Plan as a means of avoiding and mitigating impacts to  
    cultural and historic resources in the CRMW.  
  
    For Access Roads, BPA will pay a percentage not-to-exceed 17 percent  
    of actual costs of work performed.  This is a standard percentage that  
    BPA uses in road maintenance agreements during acquisition of use  
    rights.  BPA will pay the City 100 percent of the actual costs  
    associated with agreed-upon maintenance work on BPA's Service Roads.  
    If BPA performs the road improvements on Service Roads, BPA will  
    coordinate with the City prior to conducting that work.  
  
    2.3 Routine Transmission Line Maintenance Activities  
  
    BPA staff and BPA contractors will comply with the applicable  
    provisions of the CRMW Watershed Access, Water Quality, and Control  
    Regulations and Equipment Sanitation Requirements.  BPA reserves the  
    right to inspect its transmission ROWs and facilities from the air and  
    on the ground at anytime.  For reliability and maintenance purposes,  
    if BPA finds any facility in an unacceptable condition (such as  
    damaged insulators, bent tower steel, loose cotter pins, etc.), BPA  
    will notify the City and coordinate the timing of the routine repair  
    or maintenance actions.  If the City identifies issues regarding the  
    condition of a BPA facility, the City will notify BPA and coordinate  
    as appropriate.  Routine BPA maintenance activities will be avoided  
    when soil is wet to reduce soil compaction, rutting, and the resultant  
    loss in soil productivity.  
  
    BPA and the City are cognizant of the issues regarding CRMW security  
    and their relationship to National Security.  BPA and the City will  
    establish formal coordination during periods of Orange or Red Alerts  
    to ensure the security of the CRMW and the security of BPA's critical  
    energy infrastructure located therein.  BPA agrees that it is  
    responsible for damages resulting from BPA staff or BPA's contractor's  
    actions (for example, gates being left open or left unlocked, and so  
    forth) when inside the CRMW and when entering and leaving the CRMW.  
  
    2.4 Emergency Transmission Maintenance Activities  
  
    Subject to the applicable provisions of the CRMW Watershed Access,  
    Water Quality, and Control Regulations and Equipment Sanitation  
    Requirements, BPA will have 24-hour unimpeded access to the  
    transmission ROW, but will comply with CRMW Watershed Access, Water  
    Quality, and Control Regulations and Equipment Sanitation Requirements  
    in force at any particular time.  BPA performs emergency maintenance  
    and repairs in a manner and timeframe that restores reliable and safe  
    operation of the transmission system as quickly as possible.  BPA and  
    the City are cognizant of the issues regarding watershed security and  
    their relationship to National Security.  BPA and the City will  
    establish formal coordination during periods of Orange or Red Alerts  
    to ensure the security of the CRMW and the security of BPA's critical  
    energy infrastructure located therein.  
  
    2.4.1 Vegetation Emergencies  
  
    BPA reserves the right to cut hazardous brush and danger trees  
    immediately upon discovery if they are determined to be an immediate  
    hazard to the safe and reliable operation of the transmission lines.  
    If hazardous vegetation is cut in an emergency situation, BPA will  
    immediately notify the City by telephone call to Seattle Public  
    Utilities' Operations Control Center (206-386-1818) of the location  
    and will coordinate any vegetation disposal needs.  As appropriate in  
    emergency situations, the objectives developed to meet multiple  
    age/height-classes of tall-growing species on the ROW will be  
    considered.  
  
    2.4.2 Restoration of disturbed areas  
  
    Areas disturbed by emergency transmission line maintenance or repair  
    activities will be restored by BPA after consultation with the City.  
    BPA will notify the City when restoration work is planned, and when  
    restoration work is completed.  BPA is not able to guarantee that an  
    emergency situation will not require access during a wet-soil period,  
    but in that instance BPA would restore the disturbed site to as near  
    its previous condition as is practicable and repair any other harms  
    that may have been caused by those emergency activities.  
  
    2.4.3 Coordination during Emergencies  
  
    BPA will immediately notify the City by telephone call to Seattle  
    Public Utilities' Operations Control Center (206-386-1818), as soon as  
    possible concerning emergency conditions and their need to enter the  
    CRMW for emergency transmission line repairs.  The City will notify  
    BPA as soon as possible regarding any emergency conditions that may  
    affect their ability to access the CRMW.  BPA and the City will  
    exchange emergency contact information on an annual basis (at a  
    minimum) during the annual coordination meeting (see Section 2.5), or  
    more frequently as needed.  Emergency contact information (as of June  
    2003) for BPA and Seattle Public Utilities is included in Appendix C  
    and Appendix D, respectively.  
  
    2.5 Annual Coordination  
  
    BPA and the City will meet at least annually to coordinate the  
    implementation of this Maintenance Agreement.  The meeting will take  
    place at a mutually agreed upon time and location, and will be timed  
    to ensure the most effective implementation of the maintenance actions  
    (likely late fall or very early spring).  Specific topics to be  
    covered in this meeting include the following: 1) What maintenance  
    actions will occur; 2) the location of the maintenance actions; 3) the  
    costs of the maintenance actions; 4) the responsible party for the  
    actions for the given year; 5) safety planning; 6) billing procedures  
    for a given year; 7) BPA inspection procedures for actions completed  
    by the City; 8) emergency contact list updates; and 9) review of  
    previous years work and actions, with an emphasis on improving  
    coordination and identifying what worked and what didn't.  Either  
    party can add additional topics; additional meetings can be scheduled  
    at either party's request.  
  
    3.0 BILLING  
  
    The City will submit invoices, work plans, SSSPs, and estimates for  
    agreed-upon tasks to BPA for processing and approval.  Specific  
    billing and payment instructions will be established by BPA in a  
    formal contract with the City for specific work tasks to be conducted  
    for any given year.  All road and vegetation maintenance work  
    conducted by the City and paid for by BPA will be inspected before  
    payment is made.  
  
    4.0 SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS  
  
    BPA's and the City's goals for ROW vegetation maintenance are  
    described in Section 1.0 of this Maintenance Agreement. Generally,  
    except for areas otherwise designated in the Kangley-Echo Lake  
    Mitigation Action Plan and the project clearing requirements, BPA's  
    and the City's overall objective is to achieve stable, low-growing  
    native-dominated plant communities characterized by biological,  
    structural, and functional complexity.  These communities are expected  
    to inhibit the establishment of tall-growing vegetation, require  
    little or no human intervention, and resist invasion from noxious and  
    invasive plant species.  
  
    Maintenance will include treatments to control the target vegetation.  
    Maintenance activities within the ROW could occur more than once  
    during the control period (every three growing seasons).  
  
    4.1.Noxious Weeds  
  
    1. The City and BPA will evaluate existing weed populations within the  
    transmission ROW to determine the most effective treatment for control  
    and containment of those weed infestations.  Both the existing and  
    proposed transmission line corridors were surveyed for undesirable  
    species in June and July of 20011.  
  
    2. A combination of both mechanical and manual methods may be used to  
    control and contain infestations.  The 2001 Undesirable Plant Survey  
    identified the following species present on the existing ROW and/or in  
    the proposed ROW corridor:  Scot's broom, tansy ragwort, Himalayan and  
    evergreen blackberry, bull thistle, Canada thistle, St. Johnswort,  
    reed canarygrass, common tansy, herb robert, and oxeye daisy.  Several  
    species identified in the above report are not included in the King  
    County noxious weed list currently, but are recognized as undesirable  
    species.  BPA is committed to controlling those species identified by  
    the King County Weed Board as class A, B, or C weeds.  
  
    3. Eradication of noxious weeds (King Co. listed species) and  
    establishment of native species should be considered where there is a  
    high probability of success and the treatment is cost-effective.  The  
    City and BPA will determine areas to be treated and identify treatment  
    cost.  
  
    4. ROWs shall be monitored to control and prevent re-establishment of  
    undesirable vegetation. The ROW will be monitored by either/both BPA  
    and the City with maintenance to take place before plants set seed and  
    seed dispersal occurs.  
  
    5. To inhibit weeds from becoming established, areas disturbed by  
    maintenance activities will be stabilized and reseeded as soon as  
    appropriate with a seed mix approved by the City and agreed to by BPA.  
    The seed mix will contain a mixture of native grasses and shrubs that  
    will not develop into tall-growing species.  Seeding will occur in  
    either the spring or fall when seed germination is likely to be  
    successful.  If disturbed sites need immediate erosion control, straw  
    mulch or another suitable alternative will be applied immediately.  
  
    6. Personnel active in the ROW will be educated on the prevention of  
    the accidental spread of weeds to non-infested areas and will use  
    prevention techniques.  BPA will comply with all Watershed Access,  
    Water Quality, and Control Regulations and Equipment Sanitation  
    Requirements in force at any particular time.  The Equipment  
    Sanitation Requirements require that maintenance and construction  
    equipment (mowers, trailers, tractors, etc.) be washed and/or steam-  
    cleaned prior to entering the CRMW (to prevent the conveyance of  
    contaminated soils and weeds into the CRMW). In emergency repair  
    situations, the washing or steam cleaning of equipment prior to CRMW  
    entry may not be possible.  
  
    4.2 Vegetation & ROW Maintenance  
  
    Tall-growing vegetation in the ROW will be controlled while native,  
    biologically diverse, structurally complex, low-growing plant  
    communities will be encouraged to develop.  Danger trees adjacent to  
    the ROW will need to be selectively cut, but will be managed in such a  
    way as to enhance biological diversity and structural complexity in  
    and adjacent to the ROW.  All work will take place in or adjacent to  
    the existing and the proposed ROWs.  Danger trees will be identified  
    by BPA prior to their removal and BPA will work with City staff to  
    determine those appropriate management actions for those specific  
    trees that successfully address both BPA's reliability and safety  
    needs and the City's biodiversity and habitat needs (e.g., CWD, short  
    snags, etc.).  
  
    All work will be accomplished by control methods that minimize damage  
    to non-target vegetation and to low-growing plants while meeting the  
    control objectives.  Desirable low-growing plants will not be  
    disturbed where practical.  Over-time, the height of all tall-growing  
    species within the ROW from one edge to the other edge, as well as  
    identified danger trees, will be continually managed.  Height  
    management would include complete removal and/or the creation of low  
    and high snags by topping or girdling.  
  
    Further, the parties agree that:  
  
    1. Vegetation including blackberries, Scot's broom, and other species,  
    which by size or density may hinder routine inspection and  
    transmission line maintenance work or make it more hazardous, will be  
    eliminated or controlled.  BPA will designate vegetation that poses a  
    hindrance or hazard.  
  
    2. When trees are being cut that have the potential to enter the  
    minimum approach distance (MAD) for transmission lines, at least one  
    member of the tree falling crew shall be a certified line clearance  
    tree trimmer.  
  
    3. The stump height of a routinely identified off-ROW danger tree will  
    be determined on-site in coordination between the City and BPA staff  
    prior to removal.  
  
    4. No tree (on or adjacent to the ROW) is allowed to violate the MAD  
    for electrical facilities.   Directional felling methods will be used  
    to prevent trees from falling within the MAD and/or to prevent damage  
    to leave trees, roads, transmission facilities, electrical  
    distribution lines, fences, and other improvements.  
  
    5. Vegetation that will grow tall enough to interfere with the  
    operation or maintenance of the transmission facility will be managed  
    using a variety of methods, including topping, girdling, creating  
    snags, creating tall stumps, before it reaches a height or density to  
    begin competing with desirable low-growing species.  In those cases  
    where tall-growing species may take many years to reach the MAD, they  
    will be managed to a maximum height as determined by BPA and the City.  
    The maximum height will be determined for each span and identified in  
    the span-by-span prescription.  
  
    6. BPA will protect vegetated buffers along streams and wetlands and  
    retain as much vegetation as practicable and mitigate appropriately  
    for adverse impacts to vegetation and or riparian/stream function.  
    Generally riparian and wetland buffers will not exceed 400 feet on  
    each side of the stream or wetland area.  
  
    7. Within the Riparian Management Core Zones (50 feet on each side of  
    a Washington Department of Natural Resources Type 1 through 4 waterway  
    measured from the top of the bankfull banks), BPA will minimize  
    disturbance to streambank vegetation.  No ground-disturbing mechanical  
    methods will be used within riparian and wetland areas.  Equipment  
    will be kept off all slopes that exceed 20 percent.  Also,  low-  
    growing shrubs within the riparian Core Zones (not to exceed 400 feet  
    on each side of Rock Creek or the Cedar River) will be protected to  
    provide shading and soil stability.  Trees or other tall-growing  
    vegetation within the Core Zones will be managed as described under  
    Provision 5, above.  
  
    8. BPA will dispose of debris in a manner that does not create a  
    hazard or impedance to transmission line operation or maintenance.  
    BPA and the City will approve all disposal methods prior to  
    implementation.  Disposal methods could include machine cutting  
    (mulching), chipping, scattering debris, and creating brush piles  
    designed for wildlife habitat.  
  
    9. Routine BPA maintenance activities will be avoided when soil is  
    wet, to reduce soil compaction, rutting, and the resultant loss in  
    soil productivity outside of designated permanent road or tower site  
    areas.  Soil compaction will be mitigated as needed through the use of  
    appropriate measures that could include limiting equipment access;  
    using construction mats; using vegetation debris as a cushion between  
    the machine and the soil; or, in extreme situations, rehabilitating  
    specific locations by tilling/fluffing the sites.  BPA will use Best  
    Management Practices and will complete site restoration, to the extent  
    practicable, if unavoidable adverse impacts to vegetation and/or  
    riparian/stream function occur.  Special attention will be given in  
    riparian areas near Rock Creek and Cedar River to avoid siltation.  
  
    10. Service Roads shall have woody vegetation controlled so that  
    stumps do not exceed 2 inches height in the roadbed and 4 inches in  
    height off of the roadbed; all stumps are to be cut flat.  The control  
    area for all Service Roads is 25 feet wide (5 feet horizontal on the  
    cut and fill slopes) and 15 feet high (vertical clearance).  Limbs  
    will be trimmed back flush to the trunk when trees are rooted outside  
    of the control area.  Structure sites will have all vegetation  
    controlled in a 30-foot radius with stumps that do not exceed 2 inches  
    in height.  
  
    11. Maintenance activities shall be immediately halted should an  
    undocumented cultural or historical resource site or threatened,  
    endangered, or sensitive plant/wildlife species be discovered.  BPA  
    will integrate management planning for historic and cultural  
    resources, as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act and  
    any applicable state law, with its operation and maintenance  
    activities as a means to avoiding impacts to those resources.  This  
    planning will provide for avoidance of impacts to cultural resources  
    and, where appropriate, mitigation for unavoidable impacts to historic  
    properties.  BPA will coordinate with the Public & Cultural Programs  
    Manager on all proposed ground disturbing activities and emergency  
    responses to assure consistency with the Standards for Cultural  
    Resource Management provisions of the CRMW's Cultural Resource  
    Management Plan as a means of avoiding and mitigating impacts to  
    cultural and historic resources in the CRMW.  Equipment work areas  
    around transmission structures (approximately 30 feet from each tower  
    leg) will be kept free of debris and brush that would obstruct or  
    impede access to the structure.  
  
    12. Multiple age/height-classes of tall-growing species will be  
    developed on the ROW in a span-by-span management process to provide  
    habitat for a variety of birds and mammals, and other life forms.  
    Height standards for developing multiple age classes will be  
    determined in coordination with the City to enable effective contract  
    implementation and avoid individual tree marking.  
  
    13. Large woody debris (LWD) will be protected during maintenance to  
    the extent practicable.  This will provide habitat for small mammals,  
    amphibians, insects, and bird species.  
  
    14. Snags created during the construction of the proposed ROW will be  
    maintained as practicable.  
  
    15. Brush/slash piles will be protected during maintenance activities.  
    This will provide additional complexity and habitat for birds, small  
    mammals and amphibians, and invertebrates.  
  
    16. Any planted/seeded material will be protected during maintenance  
    activities.  
  
    5.0 ROAD MAINTENANCE  
  
    Service Roads will be maintained to the extent necessary to prevent  
    potential or actual adverse impacts to aquatic resources and to meet  
    City standards.  The following maintenance shall be conducted on  
    access roads:  
  
    1. BPA Service Roads in the CRMW will be maintained to control  
    erosion, run-off, and off-site transport of sediment.  
  
    2. BPA Service Road drainage structures shall be kept functional and  
    the road surface must be maintained to minimize erosion, run-off, and  
    sedimentation.  
  
    3. Maintain and repair waterbars, road ditches, and check dams.  
    Sediment shall be removed when it reaches one half the sump depth.  
    Place sediment in a stable upland location outside of the CRMW where  
    material will not erode into waters or wetlands.  
  
    4. Service road surfaces must be maintained as necessary to:  
  
    a) Minimize erosion of the surface and the subgrade.  
  
    b) Minimize direct or indirect delivery to surface waters including  
    wetlands.  
  
    c) Direct any groundwater that is captured by the road surface to a  
    stable location.  
  
    5. Keep equipment out of all wetlands, streams, and ditches except for  
    work on designed and prior-approved crossings.  
  
    6. Debris from road maintenance will be disposed of to prevent  
    deposition in riparian areas and wetlands.  
  
    7. Roadside brush will be controlled by either mechanical and/or  
    manual methods.  
  
    8. The City will maintain all gates and fences.  BPA-issued locks will  
    be on those gates required by BPA to access the transmission lines, as  
    identified in Exhibit I-2 of the Settlement Agreement.

    INTRODUCTION  
  
    The purpose of this report is to provide information and silvicultural  
    recommendations to the right-of-way (ROW) Maintenance Agreement for  
    the Raver - Echo Lake No.1, 500 kV corridor, located in the Cedar  
    River Municipal Watershed (CRMW).  A field reconnaissance of the  
    existing ROW was performed on February 10th and 11th 2003 to provide  
    the basic information that supports this ROW Maintenance Agreement.  
    The table below lists the personnel involved in the review of the ROW.

    Note:  The above individuals reviewed both the existing line corridor  
    and the proposed line corridor.  
  
    The approach was a span-by-span evaluation starting at the south  
    boundary of the watershed, between structures 4/4 and 4/5, working  
    towards the north boundary of the watershed, between structures 9/4  
    and 9/5.  Management requirements, mitigation measures, monitoring and  
    future management objectives were identified and discussed during the  
    site visit.  Along with this, tentative agreements were made regarding  
    different maintenance activities and their timing in the existing  
    corridor for the 2003 treatment, which is planned to occur in July.  
  
    SITE AND RIGHT-OF-WAY CHARACTERISTICS  
  
    A. ABIOTIC  
  
    Location: The existing right-of-way (ROW) within the City of Seattle's  
    (City) CRMW consists of approximately 100 acres, which is located in  
    the Cedar River drainage within portions of:  
  
      T. 22 N., R. 7 E., Sections 2, 11, 14, 23, 26 and 27  
      T. 23 N., R. 7 E., Section 35  
  
    Topography:  The slopes for this area range from 0% to 60%.  The  
    average slope for the area is 25%.  The aspect for most of the area is  
    south.  
  
    B. BIOTIC  
  
    General:  The existing corridor can be characterized into 4 general  
    types of vegetated condition.  Type 1 extends from the southern  
    watershed boundary (4/4 + 830) north to the south side of the Cedar  
    River (structure 5/4 + 110) and from the north side of the Cedar River  
    to structure 6/4 (structure5/4 + 1370 feet to 6/4 + 00).  Type 2 is  
    the Cedar River crossing from 5/4 + 110 to 5/4 + 1370 (near 6/1).  
    Type 3 extends from the northern side of the Cedar River (structure  
    6/1) north to the Rock Creek crossing near structure 8/4.  Type 4  
    extends from approximately the northern side of the Rock Creek  
    northward to the watershed boundary near structure 9/4.  
  
    Type 1 is sparsely vegetated and currently dominated by lower -growing  
    species including:  Scot's broom, salal, sword fern, and vine maple.  
    Tall-growing species are interspersed across the corridor, but do not  
    currently dominate the corridor.  There are also many small conifers,  
    none of which currently exceed three feet in height.  The soils in  
    this type are very rocky.  Access to this area is primarily via on-ROW  
    access roads.  
  
    Type 2 is located along the slopes leading down to the Cedar River and  
    is densely vegetated with lower -growing species including: sword  
    fern, willow and vine maple.  There are numerous tall-growing species  
    (e.g., alder, cottonwood, conifer) within the corridor.  In that  
    portion of the corridor, where the ground to conductor clearance is  
    greater than 125 feet, many of the conifers have been topped and are  
    taller than 70 feet.  Access to this type is limited due to steep  
    slopes.  However, there is access to both sides of the top of the  
    slope via both on-ROW roads, and formal off-ROW access roads that  
    parallel sections of the corridor.  There is also a City Access Road  
    (9 Road) that parallels the south side of the Cedar River.  
  
    Type 3 is densely vegetated with salmonberry, spirea, and blackberry.  
    There are tall-growing species (e.g., alder, cottonwood, conifer)  
    sparsely interspersed in this area.  The site is typically much wetter  
    than types 1 and 2. Several large wetland areas are present throughout  
    this section, in addition to several small isolated wetland areas.  
    Access to this type is via both on-ROW Service Roads, and formal off-  
    ROW Access roads that parallel sections of the corridor.  
  
    Type 4 is sparsely vegetated with similar species and densities as  
    described in Type 1.  However, the primary difference is the steepness  
    of the slopes and the southern exposure of the corridor.  This  
    topography creates a much drier site.  There are a few isolated  
    locations of Scot's broom in this type that need to receive priority  
    treatment to minimize further spread.  Access to this type is  
    primarily by switch-backing formal access roads that cross the  
    corridor between tower locations.  Short spurs access individual tower  
    sites.  
  
    MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES  
  
    BPA's management objectives in the ROW Maintenance Agreement are to  
    maintain vegetative conditions that maintain the safety and  
    reliability of BPA's electric transmission line system and access  
    roads, while at the same time minimizing environmental impacts.  The  
    goal of vegetation maintenance is the control or containment of  
    undesirable plants, and the removal of tall -growing vegetation and  
    danger trees.  BPA's overall goal is to have low-growing plant  
    communities within the ROW to control the development of undesirable  
    species (noxious weeds) and potentially hazardous vegetation (trees  
    that can grow into or fall into the minimum approach distance).  
  
    The City's main goal in participating in the ROW Maintenance Agreement  
    is to assist BPA in developing and implementing ROW maintenance that  
    is consistent with main function of the CRMW as a municipal water  
    supply and with the principles and philosophy of the CRMW Habitat  
    Conservation Plan (HCP), the current Watershed and resource management  
    plan being used by the City to manage the CRMW.  To wit, the City's  
    goal is to work with BPA to ensure that BPA's transmission projects  
    and associated facilities in the CRMW avoid erosion/sedimentation;  
    increase slope stability; enhance native biological diversity; and  
    provide quality, structurally diverse habitat for a variety of species  
    including birds, mammals, fish, and invertebrates.  A primary  
    objective is to achieve stable, low-growing native-dominated plant  
    communities within the ROW.  These communities are expected to inhibit  
    the establishment of tall-growing vegetation, require little or no  
    human intervention, and resist invasion from noxious and invasive  
    plant species.  This objective minimizes BPA's ROW maintenance needs  
    and environmental impacts while reducing BPA's long-term maintenance  
    costs, and makes BPA's activities in the CRMW more consistent with the  
    principles of the HCP.  The City of Seattle does not allow the use of  
    herbicides to manage vegetation in the CRMW.  Therefore, the ROW  
    vegetation management program for this area must use only non-chemical  
    controls, unless otherwise approved by the City.  
  
    All work will be done in accordance with the National Electric Safety  
    Code and BPA standards.  BPA and the City will meet annually to  
    discuss treatments that may be needed to meet the management  
    objectives of the ROW Maintenance Agreement between BPA and the City.  
  
    CONTROL METHODS  
  
    Maintenance will include treatments to manage the target vegetation.  
    Maintenance activities in the ROW could occur every year for the first  
    Maintenance Cycle.  Normally, the vegetation would be treated every 3  
    to 4 years.  Two general control methods are being considered.  They  
    can be used individually or in combination to control vegetation  
    including noxious weeds:  
  
    * Manual methods  
  
    * Mechanical methods  
  
    Manual Control Methods - are the control/management of vegetation by  
    pulling or cutting with hand tools including the following techniques:  
  
    * Pulling - Physically pulling vegetation from the soil.  
  
    * Cutting - using shears, clippers, chainsaws, brush saws and axes to  
    sever the above ground vegetation (including topping, pruning and side  
    -trimming).  
  
    * Girdling - cutting a ring completely around the trunk of the tree,  
    sufficiently deep into the cambium layer to kill the tree, but leave  
    it standing.  
  
    Mechanical Control Methods - are the control/management of vegetation  
    by cutting it with mowing type equipment, mounted on rubber-tired or  
    track-type tractors, including the following types of equipment:  
  
    * Mowers with rotary heads or rotating drums mounted on rubber tired  
    or track-type tractors (track hoe).  
  
    * Feller Bunchers, track-mounted machines that grab the trees, cut  
    them at the base, remove branches, cut to length, and then move them  
    to a desired location.  The feller buncher could be used during the  
    removal of C-Trees (large Cut Trees within the right-of-way) or Danger  
    Trees.  
  
    SILVICULTURAL PRESCRIPTION 2003  
  
    The Silvicultural Prescription for the existing ROW is based on  
    specific tentative agreements for maintenance of the existing ROW that  
    were discussed during the site visits on February 10th and 11th, 2003  
    between Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) and BPA.  The treatment for  
    each type for the 2003 season is listed below:  
  
    Type 1 - CRW Boundary to the Cedar River (structure 4/4 +830 feet to  
    5/4 + 490 feet), and from the north side of the Cedar River to  
    structure 6/4 (structure 5/4 + 1370 feet to 6/4 + 00 feet).  
  
    * Machine cut all Scot's broom in patches greater than 100 square  
    feet.  Machine cut all Scot's broom adjacent to roads and tower sites.  
  
    * Hand-cut Scot's broom in isolated patches less than 100 square feet.  
    Hand-pull individual small plants, which can easily be pulled, then  
    plant with native seed mix that includes a variety of shrubs (type of  
    mix will be recommended by SPU).  Scot's broom will be treated every  
    year between the treatment cycles for the tall-growing patches.  
    Machine-pull or hand-pull, re-sprouting Scot's broom in patches  
    greater than 100 square feet.  
  
    * Machine-cut all tall-growing vegetation and shrubs on ROW access  
    roads to a cleared width of 10-12 feet.  Machine cut tall-growing  
    vegetation adjacent to access roads to a width of 25 feet.  
  
    * Plant all disturbed soil locations with native seed mix that  
    includes a variety of shrubs (type of mix will be provided by SPU,  
    reviewed and agreed to by BPA) to reduce the spread of target plant  
    species and prevent soil erosion.  This seed mix can/should include  
    native grass and other herbaceous species, as well as seed of  
    appropriate shrubs whenever appropriate.  Planting will occur in  
    either the spring or fall when seed germination is likely to be  
    successful.  If disturbed sites need immediate erosion control, straw  
    mulch or another suitable alternative will be applied immediately.  
  
    * Hand-cut tall growing species (e.g., alder, cottonwood)  
  
    * Do NOT cut conifers   
    * Cut some of the small Cedars to a height of about 4 foot to provide  
    forage for deer and elk. The number per span or acre will be  
    determined in conjunction with SPU.  
  
    * Do not cut vine maple, huckleberry, or other low-growing native  
    species.  
  
    * Hand-pile slash in areas of high concentrations to create complexity  
    in woody debris habitats for small mammals.  
  
    Type 2 - Cedar River Crossing (structures 5/4 + 490 feet to 5/4 + 1730  
    feet)  
  
    * Select tree topping of (6-8) existing conifers adjacent to Cedar  
    River.  The conifers will be topped close to existing alder stand  
    height.  Instead of topping all the trees, some may be felled to  
    provide large woody debris (LWD) into the Cedar River.  Trees to be  
    felled into the river will be identified by SPU staff and BPA's  
    Natural Resource Specialist.  
  
    * On the north side of the Cedar River, selectively top conifers that  
    are approaching the conductor on both edges.  
  
    * Do not cut vine maple, huckleberry, or other low growing native  
    species.  
  
    * Hand-cut Scot's broom in isolated patches less than 100 square feet.  
    Hand-pull individual small plants, which can easily be pulled, then  
    plant with native seed mix that includes a variety of shrubs (type of  
    mix will be recommended by SPU).  Scot's broom will be treated every  
    year between the treatment cycles for the tall-growing patches.  
    Machine-pull or hand-pull, re-sprouting Scot's broom in patches  
    greater than 100 square feet  
  
    Type 3  Extends from structure 6/4 + 00 north to the Rock Creek  
    crossing near structure 8/4 + 40.  
  
    * Machine cut all tall-growing vegetation on-ROW access roads to a  
    width of 10-12 feet.  Machine cut tall-growing vegetation adjacent to  
    access roads to a width of 25 feet.  
  
    * Hand-cut tall growing species (e.g., alder, cottonwood)  
  
    * Do NOT cut conifers   
    * Hand-cut Scot's broom in isolated patches less than 100 square feet.  
    Hand-pull individual small plants, which can easily be pulled, then  
    plant with native seed mix that includes a variety of shrubs (type of  
    mix will be recommended by SPU).  Scot's broom will be treated every  
    year between the treatment cycles for the tall-growing patches.  
    Machine-pull or hand-pull, re-sprouting Scot's broom in patches  
    greater than 100 square feet.  
  
    * Cut some of the small Cedars to a height of about 4 feet to provide  
    forage for deer and elk. The number per span or acre will be  
    determined in conjunction with SPU.  
  
    * Plant all disturbed soil locations with native seed mix that  
    includes a variety of shrubs (type of mix will be provided by SPU,  
    reviewed and agreed to by BPA) to reduce the spread of target species  
    and prevent soil erosion.  This seed mix can/should include native  
    grass and other herbaceous species, as well as seed of appropriate  
    shrubs whenever appropriate.  Planting will occur in either the spring  
    or fall when seed germination is likely to be successful.  If  
    disturbed sites need immediate erosion control, straw mulch or another  
    suitable alternative will be applied immediately.  
  
    * Do not cut vine maple, huckleberry, or other low growing native  
    species.  
  
    * Hand-pile slash in areas of high concentrations to create complexity  
    in woody debris habitats for small mammals.  
  
    * Between structures 6/5 and 6/6 there is a small dry area,  
    approximately mid-span that can be mowed (the site is dominated by  
    blackberry and salmonberry).  Mowing should be used to inhibit the  
    spread of blackberry.  
  
    * Structures 8/4 - A few small patches of Scot's broom are adjacent to  
    this tower.  Because it is one of the few locations of Scot's broom  
    north of Cedar River, this patch is a high priority for removal.  The  
    broom in this area is to be pulled, and the site heavily reseeded with  
    grass and native shrubs to prevent the broom from re-infesting the  
    site.  
  
    * Instead of topping all the trees, some may be felled to provide  
    large woody debris (LWD) into the Rock Creek.  Trees to be felled into  
    the river will be identified by the SPU staff in conjunction with  
    BPA's Natural Resource Specialist.  
  
    Type 4 - Extends from approximately the north side of the Rock Creek  
    north to the watershed boundary (structure 8/4 + 140 feet to 9/4 + 291  
    feet).  
  
    * Machine-cut all on ROW access roads to a width of 35-40 feet.  
  
    * Hand-cut tall growing species (e.g., alder, cottonwood)  
  
    * Do NOT cut conifers   
    * Cut some of the small Cedars to a height of about 4 feet to provide  
    forage for deer and elk. The number per span or acre will be  
    determined in conjunction with SPU.  
  
    * Do not cut vine maple, huckleberry, or other low growing native  
    species  
  
    * Hand-cut Scot's broom in isolated patches less than 100 square feet.  
    Hand-pull individual small plants, which can easily be pulled, then  
    plant with native seed mix that includes a variety of shrubs (type of  
    mix will be recommended by SPU).  Scot's broom will be treated every  
    year between the treatment cycles for the tall-growing patches.  
    Machine-pull or hand-pull, re-sprouting Scot's broom in patches  
    greater than 100 square feet.  
  
    * Hand pile slash in areas of high concentrations to create complexity  
    in woody debris habitats for small mammals  
  
    * Plant all disturbed soil locations with native seed mix that  
    includes a variety of shrubs (type of mix will be provided by SPU,  
    reviewed and agreed to by BPA) to reduce the spread of target species  
    and prevent soil erosion.  This seed mix can/should include native  
    grass and other herbaceous species, as well as seed of appropriate  
    shrubs whenever appropriate.  Planting will occur in either the spring  
    or fall when seed germination is likely to be successful.  If  
    disturbed sites need immediate erosion control, straw mulch or another  
    suitable alternative will be applied immediately.  
  
    * Instead of topping all the trees, some may be felled to provide  
    large woody debris (LWD) into the Rock Creek.  Trees to be felled into  
    the river will be identified by the Cedar River Watershed Hydrologist  
    in-conjunction with BPA's Natural Resource Specialist.  
  
    FUTURE TREATMENT  
  
    BPA and SPU will meet yearly to discuss treatments that may be needed  
    to meet the management objectives of both BPA and SPU.  For the next  
    three years (the years between BPA's planned cutting cycle for this  
    corridor, 3-4 years) the noxious weeds within all four vegetative  
    types will be evaluated and treated using the methods described above.  
    See section 2.5 of the Maintenance Agreement for annual coordination  
    requirements.

    SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR VEGETATION CONTROL ACTIVITIES ON BONNEVILLE POWER  
    ADMINISTRATION TRANSMISSION LINE RIGHTS-OF-WAY  
  
    A. INTRODUCTION  
  
    The removal of brush and trees from power line rights-of-way entails  
    various risks, including the dangers associated with working in the  
    vicinity of energized, high-power lines and the dangers inherent in  
    the felling of trees.  The Contractor is responsible for performing  
    the work hereunder in a safe manner which is consistent with all  
    applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations to insure the  
    safety of the Contractor's employees and maintain the integrity of the  
    BPA transmission system.  The Contractor shall have an established,  
    reasonable and realistic safety program in place and it shall be  
    followed.  In addition, the Contractor shall establish a safety plan  
    for each specific job assigned under this contract and provide a copy  
    to BPA. The Contractor shall provide employees for work under this  
    contract who have been properly trained and have the requisite  
    experience to accomplish the tasks assigned them under this contract.  
  
    The safety of the Contractor's employees assigned to vegetation  
    control duties on Bonneville Power Administration transmission line  
    rights-of-way is a high priority.  Every effort will be made to insure  
    that workers are provided a work environment in which all reasonable  
    steps have been taken to insure their personal safety.  BPA offices of  
    contracting and safety will carefully review all safety programs,  
    safety plans, and other Contractor-provided information relevant to  
    safety and the experience and qualifications of the Contractor and its  
    employees.  
  
    A determination of the Contractor's level of expertise will be made by  
    BPA, based upon the safety information provided by the Contractor.  
    When specific work is contemplated to be assigned under this contract,  
    a determination of the level of expertise required for that job will  
    be made by BPA.  Only work deemed to be consistent with the  
    qualifications and level of expertise exhibited by the Contractor will  
    be assigned under this contract.  
  
    Site-specific safety plans for each project must be provided and  
    approved prior to the award of a Task Order under this contract.  The  
    plan must include all potential hazards that could be encountered  
    during work performance at the site of the project and a description  
    of how these hazards will be eliminated or minimized for the benefit  
    of Contractor's employees. The plan must include a description of the  
    procedures, methods, and personnel required to insure that all work  
    will be performed in accordance with all applicable health and safety  
    regulations.  The Contractor must further demonstrate how the safety  
    plan will be implemented.  
  
    Failure or unwillingness to adhere to the safety plans established  
    for execution of the work or a failure to exercise due diligence in  
    enforcing safety provisions at the job site may result in  
    uncompensated work stoppages directed by BPA or contract termination.  
  
    Safety, and the concern for safe working practices, shall never be  
    slighted or ignored in the interest of production.  
  
    B  SAFETY INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED BY CONTRACTOR  
  
         1.  The Contractor shall provide a comprehensive description of  
    the safety program employed by the firm.  This program description shall  
    cover, at a minimum: safety policy; safety rules; safety committee charter;  
    emergency medical plans; on-the-job injury response; accident reporting  
    procedures; operator's license requirements; specific programs on hazards  
    such as electrical, noise, chemicals, poisonous plants and animals; language  
    barriers and how Contractor will overcome them in emergency situations; and a  
    description of the type, content, and frequency of employee safety meetings.  
  
         2.  Prior to the award of a Task Order under this contract, the  
    Contractor must provide a site-specific safety plan, as discussed in A, above.  
  
         3.  In addition, the Contractor must provide the information on  
    employee's qualifications and experience, as well as corporate safety  
    records and insurance information detailed in Section N, below.  
  
         4.  The Contractor shall continue to provide safety information  
    to the Contracting Officer during the course of this contract term.  As new  
    employees are hired, the required safety information shall be provided for each  
    one.  
  
    In addition, changes in safety programs, corporate safety history and insurance  
    matters shall be provided to the Contracting Officer.  
  
    C. SAFETY WATCHERS, HOLD ORDERS AND CLEARANCES  
  
    1. Safety Watcher  
  
    In areas of possible electrical hazard, a safety watcher may be  
    necessary for the protection of workmen and facilities (both  
    Government and private).  A safety watcher is an electrical worker who  
    knows and understands the safety rules and electrical hazards involved  
    in specific work situations.  The safety watcher is responsible for  
    limiting the movement of personnel and equipment to prevent electrical  
    contact accidents.  The safety watcher has the authority to halt the  
    operation whenever any unsafe act or condition exists or is imminent.  
  
    For work such as vegetation control, the safety watcher shall  
    establish boundaries for the work area and inform the workers  
    accordingly.  These boundaries shall maintain an adequate margin of  
    safety to assure that the Minimum Approach Distances specified for the  
    circumstances will not be violated.  
  
    If a safety watcher is necessary, the Contractor shall provide  
    qualified personnel for that duty.  All safety watchers shall be  
    competent electrical workers, having satisfactory experience with  
    energized high-voltage facilities of the type located in proximity to  
    the employees they are assigned to watch.  Individuals assigned safety  
    watch duty shall hold a BPA Contractor Safety Watcher Card and shall  
    pass an oral on-site interview conducted with the BPA Chief Substation  
    Operator or designee.  Safety watchers shall have no duties other than  
    to warn the personnel working in the area of any impairment of safe  
    clearance or other possible hazards.  
  
    To qualify for the Contractor Safety Watcher Card, the individual must  
    pass a written Safety Watcher test given by BPA's Manager for  
    Substation Operations or a designee.  A list of individuals currently  
    holding valid cards will be provided to the Contractor by BPA upon  
    request.  
  
    2.  Hold Orders  
  
    Hold orders are defined as follows:  
  
      "An assurance given by a System Dispatcher or Substation Operator  
    that the re-closing relays on an energized transmission line have been  
    cut out and tagged, and that if the line relays, it will not automatically  
    return to service.  It also assures that the dispatcher will not  
    automatically order the line energized if it becomes de-energized until the  
    holder of the hold order reports the crew is in the clear."  
  
      This is a special operating order used to put the control of re-  
    energizing a facility under the direction of a dispatcher and is used to  
    protect personnel working on or near energized lines or equipment.  
  
    Normally, the power lines shall remain energized (HOT) during  
    execution of the work.  The Contractor shall request a HOLD ORDER when  
    needed.  If a HOLD ORDER is requested, the Contractor shall make the  
    request to the COTR or field inspector seventy-two (72) hours in  
    advance.  When a HOLD ORDER is in effect, only qualified line-  
    clearance tree trimmers shall perform the work.  
  
    3. Clearances  
  
    Clearances are defined as follows:  
  
      "An assurance given by a System Dispatcher or Substation Operator  
    that the transmission line is isolated from the power system (de-  
    energized) and will not be re-energized until the crew is reported in  
    the clear and the line is ready for service.  A BPA qualified electrical  
    worker must hold the clearance."  
  
    A Clearance "MUST" be required if any tree or trees have grown into,  
    or when felled, can come within the Minimum Approach Distance (MAD).  
    Table 1 specifies minimum approach distances.  
  
    D.  MINIMUM APPROACH DISTANCES  
  
    1.  It is imperative that the Contractor take every precaution to  
    insure that employees avoid contact, or come in close proximity to,  
    energized high voltage lines or parts.  No part of a worker's body or any  
    conductive object held by, or touching, a worker shall be moved closer to  
    energized high voltage lines or parts than the Minimum Approach Distances  
    specified in Tables 1 and 2, attached hereto.  
  
         a.  Table 1 specifies minimum approach distances from energized  
    conductors for qualified line-clearance tree trimmers and qualified line-  
    clearance tree trimmer trainees.  
  
         b.  Table 2 specifies minimum approach distances from energized  
    conductors for persons other than qualified line-clearance tree trimmers  
    and qualified line-clearance tree trimmer trainees.  
  
    2.  Violation of the prescriptions for minimum approach distances by  
    any employees of the Contractor will be grounds for the immediate stopping  
    of work and/or contract termination.  
  
    E. FEDERAL AND STATE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS  
  
    1.  The Contractor is responsible for complying with all federal and  
    state laws and regulations governing the activities being performed under  
    this contract, including those issued by the U.S. Department of Labor,  
    Occupational Safety & Health Administration, including OSHA 1910.266 (CFR  
    1910.266) - Logging Operations and OSHA 1910.269 (29 CFR 1910.269) -  
    Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution, and the state of  
    Washington, Department of Labor and Industries.

    Chapter 296-62 WAC (General Occupational Health Standards), Chapter 296-45  
    WAC (Safety Standards for Electrical Workers), and Chapter 296-54 WAC (Safety  
    Standards for Logging Operations).  
  
    2.  It is not intended that the list of safety-related documents  
    referenced herein is a complete and comprehensive listing of all relevant  
    documents.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to be knowledgeable  
    concerning all safety regulations applicable to activities undertaken by the  
    Contractor and to insure that operations under this contract are conducted in a  
    safe manner consistent with those regulations.  In instances where there are

    H.  ELECTRICAL HAZARDS  
  
         1.  General  
  
              All overhead and underground electrical conductors and all  
              communication wires and cable shall be considered to be energized  
              with potentially fatal voltages.  
  
              a.  Every worker shall be instructed that:  
  
               1)   a direct contact is made when any part of the body  
                    touches or contacts an energized conductor or other  
                    energized electrical fixture or apparatus.  
  
               2)   an indirect contact is made when any part of the body  
                    touches any object in contact with an energized electrical  
                    conductor or other energized fixture or apparatus.  
  
               3)  an indirect contact can be made through conductive  
                   tools, tree branches, trucks, equipment or other conductive  
                   objects, or as a result of communication wires and cables,  
                   fences, or guy wires being accidentally energized.  
  
               4)  electric shock will occur when a worker, by either  
                   direct or indirect contact with an energized conductor,  
                   energized tree limb, tool, equipment, or other object,  
                   provides a path for the flow of electricity to a  
                   grounded object or to the ground itself.  Simultaneous contact  
                   with two energized conductors will also cause electric shock  
                   that may result in serious or fatal injury.  
  
              b.  BPA should be advised before any work is performed in  
                  proximity to energized conductors.  
  
         2.  Working in Proximity to Electrical Hazards  
  
             a. An inspection shall be made by a qualified line-clearance tree  
                trimmer to determine whether an electrical hazard exists before  
                climbing or performing any work on a tree.  
  
             b.  Only a qualified line-clearance tree trimmer or qualified  
                 line-clearance tree trimmer trainee shall be assigned to the work  
                 if it is found that an electrical hazard exists.  A trainee shall  
                 be under the direct supervision of a qualified line-clearance tree  
                 trimmer.  
  
             c.  Footwear, including those having electrical-resistant  
                 soles and lineman's overshoes shall not be considered as  
                 providing any measure of safety from electrical hazards.  
  
             d.  Rubber gloves, with or without leather or other  
                 protective covering, shall not be considered as providing any  
                 measure of safety from electrical hazards.  
  
             e.  Ladders, platforms, and aerial devices, including  
                 insulated aerial devices, shall be subject to the working distance  
                 requirements contained in the tables herein.  
  
             f.  If an aerial lift device contacts an electrical conductor, the  
                 aerial device and attached equipment (such as a chipper) shall be  
                 considered as energized, and contact with the truck shall be  
                 avoided except where emergency rescue procedures are being  
                 conducted.  Emergency rescue should only be performed by trained  
                 persons familiar with electrical hazards.  
  
             g.  When an emergency conddition develops that involves electrical  
                 conductors, work shall be suspended and BPA shall be notified  
                 immediately.  
  
    I.  CREW MEMBERS  
  
         1.  Every crew assigned to perform work under this contract who will  
             encounter electrical hazards shall have at least one certified line-

         2.  The remainder of the crew shall contain sufficient numbers of  
             the appropriate labor categories to efficiently and safely accomplish  
             all tasks.  
  
    J.  AERIAL DEVICES  
  
         1.  When operating an aerial device, the operator shall look in the  
             direction of travel of the bucket and be aware of the booms in  
             relation to all other objects and hazards.  
  
         2.  Booms or buckets shall not be run into conductors, cables, poles,  
             trees and similar objects.  
  
         3.  When working in close proximity to energized overhead conductors,  
             electric cables, lights, or other conductive material shall not be  
             run from the truck to the bucket on insulated equipment.  
  
         4.  During aerial device operations, workers not engaged in line-  
             clearance shall maintain the minimum clearances discussed herein.  
  
         5.  Workers shall be instructed that insulated buckets do not protect  
             them from other electric paths to the ground, such as those through  
             trees, through a guy wire, or the path from one phase wire to the  
             second phase wire, any one of which can be fatal.  
  
    K.  JOB INTERRUPTIONS FOR SAFETY REASONS  
  
    The Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Technical Representative or  
    the Field Inspector may direct the Contractor to discontinue all operations,  
    or specific portions of  the job, for safety reasons.  If improper and unsafe  
    safety practices are observed, they  will be brought to the Contractor's  
    attention for correction.  If the Contractor does not act expeditiously in  
    correcting the matter, a partial or complete work stoppage may be ordered and  
    the Contractor shall comply immediately.  If there is imminent danger to life  
    or property, a partial or complete work stoppage may be ordered  
    immediately, with no prior notice.  
  
    BPA shall not be liable for any costs associated with BPA-directed  
    work stoppages for safety-related issues.  
  
    L.  JOB-SITE BRIEFINGS  
  
    The Contractor shall have daily work briefings for crews prior to the  
    beginning of activities for that day.  These work briefings shall  
    include and highlight safety issues in general and specific hazards to  
    be encountered that day in the planned work area.   The Contractor  
    must maintain a written record of these meetings and the specific  
    safety issues discussed.  
  
    M.  ADDITIONAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS  
  
    The Contractor shall comply with the following additional safety  
    requirements in executing the effort under this contract:  
  
         1.  Each task order will specify that a certain percentage of all of  
             the workers assigned to accomplish work under the task order shall  
             be qualified line-clearance tree trimmers, in accordance with OSHA  
             1910.269.  
  
         2.  When electrical hazards exist, the Contractor shall insure that  
             certified line-clearance tree trimmers precede the clearing parties  
             to identify and mark trees which are, or when felled may come, within  
             the minimum distances specified in the tables contained herein, which  
             will determine whether a Hold or Clearance must be requested.  In  
             addition, the line-clearance tree trimmers must determine those trees  
             which must be removed by a certified line-clearance tree trimmer.  
  
         3.  The Contractor shall use acceptable forestry instruments and  
             techniques in making the determination of tree height to conductor  
             distances and shall insure that its personnel are properly trained in

    Dear  Mr. Lynard:  
  
    This document transmits the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)  
    biological opinion based on our review of the proposed Kangley-Echo  
    Lake Transmission Line Project, and its effects on listed species in  
    accordance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as  
    amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).  Formal consultation was  
    initiated on January 22, 2002, upon receipt of the amended biological  
    assessment (BA).  
  
    This Biological Opinion (BO) is based on information provided in the  
    BA, dated July 2001, and amended on January 15, 2002; telephone  
    conversations and correspondence with the Bonneville Power  
    Administration (BPA) and Jones & Stokes Consulting; field  
    investigations, and other sources of information.  A complete  
    administrative record of this consultation is on file at the Western  
    Washington Fish and Wildlife Office in Lacey, Washington.  
  
    CONSULTATION HISTORY  
  
    Approximately half of the Kangley-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project  
    is located within the Cedar River Municipal Watershed (CRMW), which is  
    owned and managed by the City of Seattle (City).  The City prepared a  
    Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) and completed consultation with the  
    Service on April 21, 2000.  Issuance of the 50-year permit was  
    dependent upon full implementation of the specific conservation  
    provisions and species protection measures outlined in the HCP and was  
    based on the agreement that limited timber harvest would occur in the  
    watershed.  In a letter dated October 11, 2000, the Service expressed  
    concern with the proposed Kangley-Echo Lake Transmission Line since  
    the preferred alternative would result in the degradation and/or  
    removal of habitat for species covered under the incidental take  
    permit for the HCP.  
  
    On July 19, 2001, BPA prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Statement  
    (DEIS) and BA and submitted a request for informal consultation for  
    the Kangley-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project to the Western  
    Washington Office of the Service.  The Biological Assessment (BA) was  
    prepared by Jones & Stokes, an environmental consulting firm based in  
    Bellevue, Washington and was received in our office on July 23, 2001.  
    On September 4, 2001, the Service responded to the BA in a letter  
    indicating that we did not concur with the "not likely to adversely  
    affect" determination for the northern spotted owl and requested that  
    the BPA enter into formal consultation for this project.  Our non-  
    concurrence was based on the fact that the project would result in the  
    permanent removal of spotted owl habitat and widening of the 9-mile  
    long power line corridor within the Cedar River Municipal Watershed  
    HCP Area.  In our letter, the Service also requested additional  
    analysis and information related to the effects of the project on  
    habitat for the spotted owl and other forest-dependent species.  BPA  
    responded in a letter dated December 21, 2001, stating that they would  
    prepare an amended BA and would address the request for additional  
    information.  The amended BA and request for formal consultation were  
    submitted on January 22, 2002.  The amendment and a supplemental BA  
    for the 352-acre Trillium land acquisition parcel were received in our  
    office on  February 12, 2002.  
  
    The BPA received over 700 comments on the DEIS, many of them related  
    to impacts of the project on fish and wildlife habitat in the CRMW.  
    Based on the comments, BPA decided to prepare a supplement to the DEIS  
    (SDEIS) that addressed the issues raised during the public comment  
    period.  On May 22, 2002, the BPA sent out a notice stating that they  
    would prepare a SDEIS and would review additional route alternatives  
    outside of the CRMW.  The consultation was put on hold pending the  
    outcome of ongoing spotted owl surveys and the DEIS review that could  
    potentially result in the selection of a new alternative.  On January  
    14, 2003, BPA released their SDEIS.  It was received in our office on  
    January 17, 2003.  Because the preferred alternative remained the  
    same, the consultation process was resumed at that time.  The Final  
    Environmental Impact Statement is expected to be released in July and  
    the Record of Decision is to be signed in August, 2003.  
  
    The amended BA concluded that the project "may affect, and is likely  
    to adversely affect" the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis  
    caurina).  The BA also concluded that the project "may affect, but is  
    not likely to adversely affect," Puget Sound bull trout (Salvelinus  
    confluentus),  marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), and bald  
    eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and would have "no effect" on grizzly  
    bear (Ursus horribilis), gray wolf (Canis lupus), and Canada lynx  
    (Lynx canadensis).  
  
    INFORMAL CONSULTATION  
  
    The Service generally issues a biological opinion on the effects to  
    all listed species from a project in the BO.  However, the BPA  
    requested written concurrence for the Kangley-Echo Lake Transmission  
    Line Project on effects to the bull trout, marbled murrelet, and the  
    bald eagle prior to the completion of this opinion.  On February 23,  
    2002, the Service concurred with the BPA's determination that the  
    project "may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect" the bull  
    trout, marbled murrelet, and bald eagle (FWS Reference # 1-3-01-I-  
    2032).  Because consultation for the above-listed species has been  
    completed, they will not be addressed further in this BO.  The  
    following summarizes the basis for the determination as described in  
    the concurrence letter:  
  
    Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus)  
  
    The action area is located in a portion of the CRMW that does not  
    currently support a self-sustaining population of bull trout due to  
    the presence of impassable dams both upstream and downstream of the  
    project site.  There are no documented reports of bull trout in the  
    Raging River watershed.  
  
    Marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus)  
  
    The project will not affect suitable nesting habitat for the marbled  
    murrelet and is not located within 0.25 miles of any potential  
    suitable habitat.  The project is not expected to increase the risk of  
    incidental take of murrelets from possible collisions with the  
    transmissions lines because the new power line will parallel the  
    existing corridor and thus will not significantly change the aerial  
    profile of the existing hazard.  
  
    Bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)  
  
    The proposed action will not occur within 0.5 miles of any known bald  
    eagle nest or roost sites and will not remove suitable habitat for  
    this species. Surveys will be conducted prior to project  
    implementation.  If active bald eagle nest sites or roosts are  
    discovered within the project area, construction activities would be  
    limited to the seasonal operating restrictions.  
  
    BIOLOGICAL OPINION  
  
    Description of the Proposed Action  
  
    The following project description is taken from the DEIS, SDEIS, the  
    BA, correspondence, and meetings with the BPA.  The BA was amended in  
    January 2002 to incorporate additional issues raised in the September  
    4, 2001, letter sent to the BPA by the Service.  The proposed action  
    is limited to the installation, operation, and maintenance of the  
    transmission line, substation expansion, and construction and  
    maintenance of associated access roads.  Activities that differ from  
    those described in the DEIS and BA will require additional site-  
    specific consultation with the Services.  
  
    The BPA is proposing to construct a new 500 kilovolt (kV) electrical  
    transmission line in King County, Washington.  The project passes  
    through sections 11, 14, 23, 26 and 35 in T23N, R7E, and sections 2,  
    11, 14, 23, 26, and 27 of T22N, R7E (Willamette Meridian).  The  
    expansion of the line is needed to accommodate increased loads and  
    customer demand for electriCity related to the steady increase in  
    population that the Puget Sound area is experiencing.  
  
    The Kangley-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project would be constructed  
    immediately adjacent to an existing power line starting at the  
    Schultz-Raver No. 2 line near the unincorporated community of Kangley  
    in central King County and runs approximately 9 miles (mi.) north to  
    the Echo Lake Substation just southwest of the community of North Bend  
    (see Figure 1).  Approximately 5 miles of the project is located  
    within the Cedar River Municipal Watershed and is administered by the  
    City of Seattle as an ecological reserve.  The remainder of the  
    project transects a variety of land ownerships, including commercial  
    forest lands and rural residential areas.  
  
    Construction of the new transmission line will require the  
    installation of 47 new lattice steel towers spaced at an average span  
    of approximately 1,150 feet apart.  The majority of the towers on the  
    proposed line will be 135-foot tall "suspension" towers.  Towers that  
    span major river corridors will be taller to avoid the necessity to  
    clear trees which will minimize impacts to the riparian vegetation.  
    Prior to construction, most of the trees and brush within 150 feet of  
    the edge of the existing corridor and extending the full 9 mile length  
    of the power line will be cleared.  Clearing the new right-of-way  
    (ROW) corridor will double the width of the existing opening to  
    approximately 300 feet and will result in the permanent removal of  
    approximately 120 acres of forest stands, the oldest of which are 75  
    years old.  Disposition of merchantable timber will be determined  
    through agreements with the landowners.  Non-merchantable timber and  
    brush may be chipped, lopped and scattered or removed by other means.  
    No brush burning will be allowed due to the proximity of the project  
    to the existing power line.  If there are danger trees next to the  
    newly cleared ROW, these trees would also be removed.  Danger trees  
    could be taken as far as 200 feet from the outer edge of the ROW.  
  
    Figure 1-Kangley-Echo Lake Transmission  
    Line Action Area Location and Ownerships  
  
    Currently, the BPA is collecting data and analyzing the feasibility of  
    using different clearing criteria within the CRMW that would result in  
    fewer large trees being removed.  Tree topping, rather than felling,  
    is the preferred method of treatment of large trees in the riparian  
    areas.  
  
    Transmission towers are normally assembled in sections at a tower site  
    and lifted into place by a large crane (30-200 ton capaCity).  The BPA  
    is proposing to reduce the amount of ground disturbance, vegetation  
    removal, and road construction within the CRMW by using a heavy lift  
    helicopter (sky crane) to remove logs and move and place the towers  
    components.  The helicopter will be also be used in inaccessible areas  
    such as the Raging River canyon.  A new type of footing, called  
    micropiles, requires less ground disturbance than traditional footings  
    and will be used within the CRMW portion of the project area.  Some  
    blasting may be needed to prepare footings in areas of bedrock or  
    steep slopes.  Installation of micropiles involves augering holes  
    about 6 inches in diameter to a depth of approximately 30 feet.  Steel  
    bars are then inserted into the holes and grouted in place with  
    cement.  The micropiles would be installed with a light weight track-  
    mounted drill rig.  Site grading would not be required.  Brush  
    clearing would only be necessary to provide access for the drill rig.  
    With this new design, the tower legs are positioned above ground, thus  
    significantly reducing the amount of excavation required.  The minimum  
    conductor-to-ground clearance for a 500-kV line is about 30 feet.  
    Greater clearances are provided over roads, railroads, residential  
    areas and rivers.  
  
    While the use of ground-based equipment will be minimized within the  
    CRMW, the traditional crane construction technique and log haul  
    methods will be used on the rest of the project (60 percent of the  
    action area).  Providing equipment access will require the  
    construction of approximately 2.9 miles of new gravel roads.  
    Approximately 17.1 miles of existing powerline roads will be improved  
    and another 0.6 miles of access roads will be decommissioned.  
    Improvements to the existing access roads would include repair and  
    replacement of malfunctioning or undersized culverts, and localized  
    installation of waterbars and cross-drain culverts.  Just under half  
    of the new road construction (1.36 miles) and 10.9 miles of the road  
    improvements would occur within the CRMW.  The new gravel spur roads  
    would run from the existing power line road to the new tower  
    locations.  Bulldozers will be used for road construction and to clear  
    and level the new tower sites.  
  
    Under the current proposal, the Echo Lake Substation would be expanded  
    to the east on land owned by BPA.  The site would be cleared, graded,  
    fenced, and a gravel parking lot would be added.  The substation site  
    would be expanded by approximately 150 by 750 feet.  Clearing widths  
    for the new access and spur road sections would be approximately 20  
    feet wide.  New access roads would be surfaced with gravel and  
    appropriately designed for drainage and erosion control.  
  
    Altogether, tower installation and road work would result in the  
    removal of approximately 120 acres of forest vegetation, will impact  
    14 acres of wetlands, cross or affect 11 fish-bearing and numerous  
    smaller streams, upgrade 3 culverts for fish passage, and result in  
    the installation 27 new cross drain culverts.  No trees will be  
    removed within 150 feet of the Cedar River.  Approximately 16 trees  
    (all but one are alders) will need to be removed within the 100-150  
    foot riparian zone of the Raging River.  All ground-disturbing  
    activities are scheduled to be conducted during the driest time of the  
    year (summer/early fall).  Temporary roads and disturbed areas will be  
    seeded and stabilized after project completion.  Storage areas will be  
    located near major highways and will also be used as re-fueling  
    stations.  
  
    To compensate for the permanent loss of habitat and impacts to the  
    Cedar River HCP caused by the project, the BPA has purchased the 352-  
    acre Trillium parcel from the Trust for Public Lands and is engaged in  
    negotiations to acquire a 640-acre parcel from Plum Creek Timber  
    Company.  The two compensation sites are located adjacent to the CRMW.  
    When transactions are completed, approximately 110 acres of the  
    southern portion of the Trillium parcel and 363 acres of the northern  
    half of the Plum Creek parcel would be transferred to the City of  
    Seattle.  The remaining 240 acres of the Trillium parcel and 277 acres  
    of the Plum Creek parcel will be placed into conservation easements to  
    prevent commercial and residential development of the land.  
  
    The Trillium site is located in T23N, R7E, Section 26.  The parcel  
    currently has approximately 61 acres of 40-65-year old second-growth  
    stands, with the remainder in young recently harvested plantations and  
    mixed conifer-hardwood communities.  The Plum Creek site is located in  
    T22N, R07W, Section 25.  Most of this parcel consists of young  
    plantations and does not currently meet the definition of spotted owl  
    habitat.  
  
    Negotiations are also under way for a possible land exchange involving  
    a 100-acre parcel on the eastern edge of the CRMW currently  
    administered by the Forest Service.  If completed, another 100 acres  
    could be added to the City of Seattle's CRMW.  Because completion of  
    this land exchange is not necessary to meet BPA's ESA obligations and  
    likely will take several years to complete, this proposed land  
    exchange is outside the scope of this consultation.  
  
    RANGEWIDE STATUS OF THE SPECIES  
  
    The northern spotted owl (spotted owl) was listed as a threatened  
    species on June 26, 1990, as a result of declining populations and the  
    loss of suitable habitat from timber harvesting (USDI 1990b).  For a  
    detailed account of the taxonomy, biology, and status of the spotted  
    owl, please refer to the following documents:  Forsman et al. (1984),  
    the Interagency Scientific Committee (ISC) report (Thomas et al.  
    1990), the 1990 status review (USDI 1990b), the BOs for the Section  
    318 timber sale programs (USDI 1990c and USDI 1990d, respectively),  
    the final rules for listing and critical habitat (USDI 1990b and  
    1992b), the final draft spotted owl recovery plan (USDI 1992a), the  
    report of the Scientific Analysis Team (SAT; Thomas et al. 1993), the  
    Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team report (FEMAT; USDA 1993),  
    supporting documents for the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) (USDA and  
    USDI 1994a and b), the Biological Opinion for the NWFP (USDI 1994),

    Statement (FEIS) on Forest Practices Rule Proposals (WDNR 1995), the  
    Proposed Special Rule for the Conservation of the Northern Spotted Owl  
    on Non-Federal Lands (4(d) Rule) (USDI 1995), the Contribution of

    of the Contribution of Federal and Non-Federal Habitat to Persistence  
    of the Northern Spotted Owl on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington: A  
    Report of the Futher Analysis Team (Raphael et al. 1995), and recent  
    demographic reports (Forsman et al. 1996 and Franklin et al. 1999).  
    On January 15, 1992 (USDI 1992b), the Service designated 6,887,000  
    acres of spotted owl critical habitat, solely on federal lands.  This  
    designation provided additional protection to the species by requiring  
    federal agencies to consult with the Service on actions that may  
    affect the primary constituent elements of spotted owl critical  
    habitat.  
  
    Since the listing, the conservation strategies for the spotted owl  
    were based upon the principles first articulated in the ISC's report  
    and are summarized as follows:  
  
    1.     Species that are well distributed across their range are less  
           prone to extinction than species confined to small portions of their  
           range;  
  
    2.     Large blocks of habitat, containing multiple pairs of the  
           species, are superior to small blocks of habitat with only one to a  
           few pairs;  
  
    3.     Blocks of habitat that are close together are better than  
           blocks far apart;  
  
    4.     Habitat that occurs in less fragmented (that is, contiguous)  
           blocks is better than habitat that is more fragmented; and  
  
    5.     Habitat between blocks is more effective as dispersal habitat  
           if it resembles suitable habitat.  
  
    As in the ISC's Conservation Strategy, the NWFP emphasizes protection  
    of large blocks of habitat (late-successional reserves or LSRs) to  
    provide for clusters of breeding pairs of owls (and other late-  
    successional forest species) that are connected by habitat (matrix) to  
    support survival and movement across the landscape between reserves.  
    The NWFP reserve network is designed to protect late-successional  
    forest species, such as the owl.  While the Forest Ecosystem  
    Management Team (FEMAT) scientists expected owl populations to decline  
    in the matrix over time, populations were expected to stabilize and  
    eventually increase within LSRs as habitat conditions improved over  
    the next 50-100 years (USDA 1993; USDA/USDI 1994a and b).  Hence, the  
    NWFP is expected to provide for a more stable and better distributed  
    population of late-successional forest species, including the owl,  
    over time.  
  
    Although all previous efforts to develop conservation plans for the  
    spotted owl identified the importance of contributions from non-  
    federal (including state, Tribal, and private) lands, specific  
    expectations for these lands have never been finalized.  As a result,  
    most interactions with these landowners rely on the recommendations in  
    the ISC plan (Thomas et al. 1990), the Final Draft Recovery Plan (USDI  
    1992a), FEMAT (USDA et al. 1993), and the NWFP (USDA/USDI 1994a) as  
    general guidance.  Since implementation of the NWFP in 1994,  
    consistency with and support to that final draft recovery plan (for  
    the spotted owl) has been the primary focus of conservation efforts  
    with non-federal landowners.  The Service's primary expectations for  
    these lands are for contributions to demographic support (pair or  
    cluster protection) or to provide connectivity with NWFP lands.  A  
    review of the 13 HCPs issued to date that address the spotted owl  
    indicates that they are generally providing those functions across the  
    landscape.  However, there is a considerable time scale difference  
    between HCPs and actions consulted on for the NWFP and other agencies;  
    the term of most large-scale HCPs covers periods of 20 to 100 years  
    (and more) whereas the term of actions on NWFP lands is typically 1 to  
    5 years.  Therefore, effects from HCPs and their contributions need to  
    be considered over a longer time frame.  
  
    The State Forest Practice Regulations across the range of the spotted  
    owl are as follows:  
  
    C   Washington:  The State Forest Practices Board adopted rules (USDI  
    1995) that would "contribute to conserving the spotted owl and its  
    habitat on non-federal lands," based on recommendations from a Science  
    Advisory Group which identified important non-federal lands and  
    recommended roles for those lands in spotted owl conservation (Hanson  
    et al. 1993, Buchanan et al. 1994).  Owl-related HCPs in Washington  
    generally provide the demographic support and connectivity support  
    that are recommended in these reports, and the final draft recovery  
    plan (USDI 1992a), and provide support to the NWFP.  
  
    C   Oregon:  The Oregon Forest Practices Act provides for protection  
    of 70-acre spotted owl core areas around known nest sites, but does  
    not provide for protection of spotted owl habitat beyond these areas  
    (ODF 2000).  In general, there is no large-scale spotted owl habitat  
    protection strategy or mechanism currently present on non-federal  
    lands in Oregon.  The four spotted owl-related HCPs currently in  
    effect address relatively few acres of land; however, they will  
    provide some nesting habitat and connectivity over the next few  
    decades (USDI 2001).  For instance, one HCP covered over 200,000 acres  
    critically located between 2 LSRs and the Elliott State Forest.  That  
    HCP is intended to provide a landscape conducive to dispersal  
    beginning in 2014 and lasting until 2044.  
  
    C   California:  In 1990, State Forest Practice Rules, which govern  
    timber harvest on private lands, were amended to require surveys for  
    spotted owls in suitable habitat and to provide protection around  
    activity centers (CDF 2001).  Under the Forest Practice Rules, no  
    timber harvesting plan can be approved if it is likely to result in  
    incidental take of federally-listed species, unless authorized by a  
    federal HCP.  The California Department of Fish and Game reviewed all  
    timber harvest plans to ensure that incidental take was not likely to  
    occur, and the Service took over that review function in 2000.  
    Several large industrial owners operate under Spotted Owl Management  
    Plans, concurred with by the Service, in which they've specified the  
    basic measures they will undertake for spotted owl protection.  Three  
    HCPs, authorizing take of spotted owls, have been approved.  
    Implementation of these plans will provide for spotted owl demographic  
    and connectivity support to NWFP lands.  
  
    In 1994, the confirmed number of spotted owls range-wide was 3,602  
    pairs and 957 resident singles (Thomas et al. 1993).  However, the  
    report stated that the population was probably higher because survey  
    information was lacking for many areas.  This figure was refined with  
    the development of the 4(d) rule, using additional data from federal,  
    state, tribal, and private land management agencies.  In 1995, the  
    estimated number of northern spotted owls range-wide was 5,608  
    activity sites (pairs and singles combined), of which 1,322 were  
    located on non-federal lands, primarily in the coastal region of  
    northern California (USDI 1995).  
  
    Range-wide declines in spotted owl populations are of concern, but  
    were expected under the NWFP.  This decline was expected as a result  
    of allowable harvest in Matrix and Adaptive Management Area Land Use  
    Allocations.  However, spotted owl populations are expected to improve  
    and stabilize over time as the condition of LSRs improves (USDA and  
    USDI 1994a).  Recent demography studies indicate that the total  
    spotted owl population is declining (Burnham et al. 1996, Franklin et  
    al. 1999).  Franklin et al.(1999) indicated that, while still  
    declining at an average of 3.9 percent per year range-wide, the degree  
    and extent of the decline may be less severe than previously  
    indicated.  They found a decline rate slower than that in 1993, and  
    that adult females survival rates, overall, were no longer declining  
    over time.  They concluded that the 1998 demographic analysis seemed  
    to "conform" to the expectations in the BO for the NWFP.  
  
    It is unknown whether the changes in population trends reflect  
    responses to reduction in timber harvest on federal lands or simply  
    more years of data (Franklin et al. 1999).  Data have been collected  
    only for a few years, and may be subject to short-term boom-or-bust  
    cycles, with each additional year having a significant impact on the  
    trend.  In any case, some decline is expected to occur as spotted owl  
    sites with severely degraded habitat conditions become inactive,  
    implementation of the NWFP is expected to eventually abate the decline  
    by protecting all spotted owl sites within LSRs (USDI 1994).  The NWFP  
    is expected to provide for the conservation of the species by allowing  
    non-suitable, but capable habitat to regenerate within the LSRs to  
    allow the population to increase and stabilize across its range.  
  
    West Cascades Physiographic Province  
  
    Three subprovinces are recognized within the Washington West Cascades  
    Physiographic Province: the northern, Interstate 90 (I-90), and the  
    southern.  The southern subprovince includes Mt. Rainier National  
    Park, the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, and the Columbia Gorge  
    National Scenic Area.  The I-90 subprovince lies between the northern  
    and southern subprovinces and is characterized by low spotted owl  
    densities, checkerboard ownership, and a high degree of habitat  
    fragmentation.  For these reasons, the Service has identified the I-90  
    subprovince as an "area of concern" because of the potential to  
    demographically divide and isolate these two subprovinces and the  
    Washington Western Cascades Province from the Washington Eastern  
    Cascades Province (USDI 1991).  
  
    The Service (1991) reported that "spotted owl habitat is patchy in the  
    subprovince, primarily due to natural topographical variation and  
    timber harvest.  Most low elevation owl habitat has been harvested;  
    the remaining contiguous blocks of owl habitat are poorly distributed  
    within steeply-sloped watersheds bordered by high elevation ridges and  
    peaks.  Few blocks of older forest habitat remain on state, private,  
    and municipal lands; most of the currently known spotted owls on these  
    lands occur on isolated remnant patches that escaped historic fires  
    and harvest.  Natural habitat fragmentation and land ownership  
    patterns make it very difficult to attain large contiguous blocks of  
    lower elevation habitat.  Both spotted owl densities and reproductive  
    success are lower in the north half of the province than in the  
    southern half.  Because of the high degree of habitat fragmentation  
    (natural and human-caused), no large clusters of spotted owls  
    presently occur in this subprovince, nor are they expected in the  
    future.  There is limited potential to attain 20-pair clusters.  
    Because much of the habitat in lower elevations has been eliminated,  
    interchange between remaining individuals or small clusters of owls  
    are likely inhibited to some degree by non-forested high elevation  
    ridges, peaks, and glaciers."  
  
    Habitat  
  
    Much of the old-growth forest habitat was harvested over the last  
    century (Booth 1991; Bolsinger and Wadell 1993; Zybach 1993; Ripple  
    1994; Perry 1995).  More than 80 percent of prelogging old-growth  
    forests had been removed by the early 1980s (Booth 1991).  Although  
    not all old-growth forests are suitable spotted owl habitat, this  
    great decrease suggests that the 7.6 million acres of habitat that  
    remains today represents only a small portion of the area formerly  
    occupied by spotted owls (USDA 1991 in USDI 1992b).  About 10 percent  
    of pre-settlement old-growth remains in western Washington (Booth  
    1991), and what is left is highly fragmented.  Logging, urbanization,  
    and agricultural development have all contributed to the loss of this  
    habitat.  The loss of old-growth habitat is most concentrated at lower  
    elevations.  Remaining suitable spotted owl habitat is not distributed  
    evenly over the range of the species (Thomas et al. 1990).  Habitat  
    reduction has been greatest in low elevations in Oregon and  
    Washington, and remaining populations of spotted owls are considered  
    low in these areas.  Remaining habitat at higher elevations may be of  
    lower quality than that historically present at lower elevations  
    (Thomas et al. 1990).  Thus, the approximately 50 percent of remaining  
    spotted owl habitat currently in federally reserved areas or in areas  
    unsuited for timber harvest may not contribute proportionately to  
    spotted owl productivity, because these lands are at higher  
    elevations.  
  
    Reproductive Success  
  
    Recent studies suggest that reproductive success among spotted owls  
    may vary between geographic areas (Carey 1985) and years (Forsman  
    1988; Franklin et al. 1990).  Furthermore, the number of pairs  
    attempting to nest annually varies from 40 to 60 percent of the total  
    potential breeding pairs (USDI 1990a).  However, in some years almost  
    complete breeding failures have been noted (Barrows 1985), and the  
    numbers of young fledged per pair also may vary substantially from one  
    year to the next (Miller 1989).  While there are differences in the  
    natural stand characteristics that influence provincial home range  
    size, anthropogenic habitat loss and forest fragmentation effectively  
    reduce home range habitat quality.  Spotted owls with less than 40  
    percent of their home range in suitable habitat have reduced nesting  
    success (Bart and Forsman 1992).  
  
    Dispersal  
  
    Dispersal, the process of leaving one area to establish a new home  
    range in another area, is undertaken by both juvenile and adult  
    spotted owls.  Adult spotted owls are known to leave mates or move  
    from established territories, but the causes for adult dispersal  
    events are unknown.   The dispersal and ultimate fate of juveniles is  
    an important component of spotted owl demography.  A great deal more  
    is known about the process and pattern of juvenile spotted owl  
    dispersal than of adult dispersal (Gutierrez et al. 1985).  Dispersal  
    among juveniles generally occurs immediately following the fledgling  
    period, usually June to September.  During this period, young spotted  
    owls are fed regularly by their parents and the juveniles seldom move  
    farther than 0.5-miles from the nest site.  Once the parents stop  
    feeding the fledglings, the juveniles begin to move away from the  
    adults' territory.  Dispersal of juvenile spotted owls from their  
    natal areas usually begins in September and October once the young  
    birds have attained adult body size (Gutierrez et al. 1985).  Initial  
    dispersal is usually rapid, in random directions (Gutierrez et al.  
    1985), and distances traveled vary between 9 and 30 miles (Gutierrez  
    et al. 1985).  Herter and Hicks (1995) found that dispersal of  
    juveniles away from the nest site during the fall (i.e., September and  
    October) usually consists of an initial long distance movement,  
    followed by lesser distance movements throughout the late fall and  
    winter.  There is, however, substantial variation in distances  
    traveled and patterns of movement among individuals.  Some birds have  
    been found to move at an almost continual rate during their first fall  
    and winter, whereas other individuals moved relatively little  
    following initial dispersal.  Many of the juveniles that survive the  
    winter show a resurgence of movement in early spring.  This may be in  
    response to territorial defense and subsequent displacement by  
    resident spotted owls, or depletion of prey resources.  Other studies  
    have suggested that juveniles use a wide variety of habitat and forest  
    types during dispersal (Gutierrez et al. 1985).  During the dispersal  
    phase, juvenile survival rate is low (Gutierrez et al. 1985).  Studies  
    on survivorship of juveniles have shown that survival rates for this  
    age class are low; the chance of a juvenile living through its first  
    year have been reported to be between 5 and 29 percent relative to the  
    adult survival rate (Thomas et al. 1990).  The rigors of dispersal and  
    inexperience (e.g., poor hunting skills, lack of familiarity with a  
    territory) are most likely responsible for the higher mortality rate.  
    At this time, the young birds are particularly vulnerable to  
    starvation and predators such as the great horned owl (Bubo  
    virginianus) (Forsman et al. 1984) and the goshawk.  Juveniles  
    probably have enough fat resources to sustain themselves from  
    September (when adults discontinue feeding the young) to about the  
    middle of December or January.  
  
    Survivorship  
  
    Spotted owls die from a wide variety of causes.  The most frequent  
    cause of death is predation by other animals (USDI 1992b).  Other  
    causes of mortality include accidents (i.e., flying into objects) and  
    starvation (Gutierrez et al. 1985).  Starvation occurs most frequently  
    among juvenile spotted owls (Sisco 1990).  Juvenile and subadult  
    survival rates are lower than those of adults.  Annual survival rates  
    of adults are relatively high.  Overall, the probability of an adult  
    spotted owl living from one year to the next is 81 to 96 percent  
    (Barrowclough and Coats 1985; Franklin et al. 1990; Thomas et al.  
    1990).  When comparing spotted owl populations on the east and west  
    sides of the Cascade Crest, west side spotted owls are longer-lived,  
    but are less productive.  
  
    Predation and Competition  
  
    Key predators of spotted owls include the great horned owl, northern  
    goshawk, and red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) (USDI 1992b).  Among  
    these predators, the great horned owl is the most common predator of  
    the spotted owl.  Great horned owls have become more abundant  
    throughout much of the range of the northern spotted owl; however,  
    habitat differences between the two species make it difficult to  
    measure the severity of this threat to the spotted owl.  Although  
    these two species commonly share similar habitat, the great horned owl  
    tends to forage in more open habitats than those used by the spotted  
    owl.  Northern goshawks also prey on adult and juvenile spotted owls  
    (Forsman et al. 1984; Gutierrez et al. 1985).  Nevertheless, spotted  
    owls will nest within a goshawk territory, and will defend their young  
    against attacks by goshawks (Forsman et al. 1984).  
  
    Competition can be a serious problem for any species when an "exotic"  
    species of similar body size and ecological requirements invades its  
    habitat.  The recent invasion of the northern barred owl (Strix varia  
    varia) into the range of the spotted owl poses a threat to the spotted  
    owl through competition.  Barred owls are larger and more aggressive  
    than spotted owls.  They also feed on a broader array of prey items  
    (Hamer et al. 2001), occupy a wider range of habitat types, and have  
    smaller annual home ranges than do the spotted owls (Hamer 1988).  
    Occupied spotted owl sites have decreased as barred owl sites have  
    increased in a number of locations such as the central Cascades (L.  
    Hicks, pers. comm.), the southern Gifford Pinchot, Wenatchee, and  
    Okanogan National Forests (T. Fleming, pers. comm.), and on the  
    Olympic Peninsula (Forsman and Biswell 1999).  Furthermore, barred  
    owls are known to have displaced spotted owls from some territories  
    (USDI 1992b, Kelly 2001, Pearson and Livezey in prep.).  In the  
    Olympic National Forest demographic study area, the number of  
    monitored spotted owl sites with northern barred owls in them has been  
    increasing annually while the number of spotted owl sites in which the  
    spotted owl can be detected has been decreasing annually since the  
    early 1990s (Forsman and Biswell 1999).  Both studies that tested the  
    influence of barred owls on spotted owl site occupancy found that  
    spotted owl site occupancy was significantly lower in sites with  
    barred owls than in sites without barred owls; the study areas for  
    these studies were throughout Washington and Oregon (Kelly 2001) and  
    the Gifford Pinchot National Forest (Pearson and Livezey, in prep).  
    The barred owls' increasing expansion into the range of the spotted  
    owl may pose a serious threat because barred owls use the same  
    habitats as spotted owls, feed on a much wider variety of prey, and  
    behave aggressively toward spotted owls.  In addition, hybridization  
    between the two species has been documented (Hamer et al. 1994),  
    although it does not appear to be frequent.  The final draft recovery  
    plan noted the rapid expansion of barred owls into the range of the  
    spotted owl.  In the central Cascades, Herter and Hicks (2000)  
    reported that spotted owls were slightly more common than barred owls.  
  
    Disease and Parasitism  
  
    Relatively little is known about the effects of diseases and parasites  
    on spotted owls.  Gutierrez (1989) conducted a survey of hematozoan  
    parasites among all three subspecies of the spotted owl.  He reported  
    that five of the six hematozoan species were found in the northern  
    spotted owl and the infection rate (100 percent) was one of the  
    highest by these parasites recorded among birds (Greiner et al. 1975).  
    USDI (1992b) suggested that spotted owls must be highly adapted to  
    carry these high parasite loads because their survival rates are high  
    despite high infection rates.  In a study of infection levels by round  
    worms, flat worms, and spiny-head worms in 20 spotted owls, Hoberg et  
    al. (1989) found that more than 80 percent of the birds were infected  
    with at least one worm species, and multiple infections were common.  
    Infestation of nests and owlets by parasites may cause severe trauma  
    to the young birds (USDI 1992b), but the overall effect of external  
    and internal parasites and diseases on spotted owl survival, growth,  
    and reproductive capaCity is unknown.  
  
    MANAGEMENT HISTORY  
  
    Interagency Scientific Committee Report  
  
    In 1990, the Interagency Scientific Committee (ISC) (Thomas et al.  
    1990) identified various geographic units termed Habitat Conservation  
    Areas (HCAs) which were intended to support spotted owl pairs.  The  
    HCAs were divided into two categories: Category 1 HCAs included  
    habitats capable of supporting 20 pairs of spotted owls and Category 2  
    HCAs included habitats capable of supporting 2 to 19 pairs of spotted  
    owls.  Within this context, intervening habitat between HCAs was  
    considered for dispersal habitat and connectivity, which resulted in  
    the development of the "50-11-40 rule."  
  
    In addition to the HCA units identified by the ISC, physiographic  
    provinces described by Franklin and Dyrness (1988) provided a  
    recognized set of landscape subdivisions incorporating the physical  
    and environmental factors that shape the landscape of the Pacific  
    Northwest.  The provinces identified in the State of Washington were  
    the Washington Cascades East, Olympic Peninsula, Washington Cascades  
    West, and Southwest Washington.  These physiographic provinces were  
    modified and used in the ISC as the first subdivision of the range of  
    the spotted owl (Thomas et al. 1990).  
  
    These provinces were further subdivided by areas of special concern,  
    where past natural occurrences and human actions have adversely  
    affected habitat more than in the remainder of the province.  The  
    areas of special concern consisted of the North Cascades, North  
    Cascades East, Olympic Peninsula, Southwest Washington, and Columbia  
    River Gorge; the Oregon Coast Range and southern Deschutes in Oregon;  
    and, the Shasta-McCloud, North Coastal California, and Mendocino  
    National Forest in California (Thomas et al. 1990).  
  
    Final Draft Recovery Plan  
  
    As a primary means for achieving recovery of the spotted owl, the  
    final draft Recovery Plan (USDI 1992a) recommended establishing 192  
    Designated Conservation Areas (DCA) covering more than 7.6 million  
    acres of federal forest lands as the primary habitat for the spotted  
    owl.  The DCA network represented approximately 46 percent of the  
    total estimated spotted owl nesting, roosting, and foraging (NRF)  
    habitat on federal lands.  The Recovery Plan remains in draft form; a  
    final plan was not issued.  Many of the concepts developed in the ISC  
    Report and the final draft Recovery Plan were applied in the NWFP.  
  
    Northwest Forest Plan  
  
    The next phase in spotted owl management was the formation of the  
    FEMAT in 1993.  The FEMAT was an interagency, interdisciplinary team  
    of experts which produced a report assessing ten options for  
    management of Federal forests within the range of the spotted owl.  
    This served as the basis for President Clinton's proposed Forest Plan  
    which was announced on July 1, 1993, and analyzed in a Draft SDEIS.  
    The Final SDEIS was made available to the public in February 1994  
    (USDA and USDI 1994a).  The Record of Decision and standards and  
    guidelines for habitat management for late-successional forest species  
    issued in April 1994 provide for an integrated reserve system based  
    largely on the protection of habitat within multiple-purpose  
    watersheds.  Late-Successional and Riparian Reserves were incorporated  
    to assure the viability of threatened and at-risk species, as  
    determined by "viability panels" tasked to predict the likelihood of  
    persistence under each option.  Adaptive Management Areas were created  
    to test technical and social objectives associated with the overall  
    strategy of ecosystem management.  The Northwest Forest Plan allocated  
    more than 24 million acres of federal lands into six designated  
    categories (Congressionally Reserved Areas, LSRs, Adaptive Management  
    Areas, Managed Late-Successional Areas, Administratively Withdrawn  
    Areas, and Riparian Reserves) and one non-designated category referred  
    to as Matrix.  
  
    Past land management activities have degraded suitable spotted owl  
    habitats throughout the range of the species.  The NWFP was developed  
    to address the conservation of the spotted owl and other species on  
    federal lands.  The basic conservation strategy in the NWFP improves  
    upon the measures developed by the ISC (Thomas et al. 1990).  The NWFP  
    provides for the protection of extensive Federal forest reserves which  
    are intended to support large, reproductively viable spotted owl  
    population clusters throughout the range of the species on Federal  
    lands.  The system of LSRs (7,430,800 acres) will not only protect  
    habitat currently suitable for spotted owls, but also develop future  
    habitat in large blocks. The Service considers the NWFP to be the  
    cornerstone for owl recovery.  
  
    Through implementation of the NWFP, Federal lands are expected to  
    carry the major burden of conservation and recovery of late-  
    successional habitats and associated species, including spotted owls.  
    The expectation is that spotted owl populations will not decline  
    beyond a viable level during the 50 to 150-year critical transition  
    period and will eventually stabilize at a new equilibrium once  
    suitable habitats have regrown within the Federal reserves (USDA et  
    al. 1993).  Federal reserves are not expected to be fully restored to  
    80 percent suitable habitat for approximately 100 years (USDA and USDI  
    1994a).  
  
    The FEMAT spotted owl viability panel predicted an 83 percent  
    likelihood that habitat conditions would provide for well-distributed,  
    stable populations of spotted owls on Federal lands (USDA et al. 1993;  
    USDA and USDI 1994a (App. J3).  The ISC Plan and NWFP noted that non-  
    Federal lands have a role to play in contributing to the conservation  
    of the spotted owl (Thomas et al. 1990; USDA and USDI 1994a).  
  
    In 1994, the Service issued a BO on the Forest Plan that assessed the  
    effects of adopting this comprehensive management plan on federal  
    lands.  In that BO, we concluded that it would provide for a stable  
    and self-sustaining spotted owl population on federal lands and, on  
    that basis, provide the Federal contribution to owl recovery.  Since  
    1994, the Service has consulted on many actions associated with  
    implementation of the Forest Plan and other federal activities that  
    may affect the spotted owl or its critical habitat.  The geographic  
    scale of these consultations varies from individual timber sale HCPs  
    to multiple actions covering multiple administrative units, depending  
    on the scope of the proposed Federal action.  In general, the  
    analytical scale of these consultations is based on the  
    reserve/connectivity goals of the Forest Plan and expressed in terms  
    of changes in suitable owl habitat.  
  
    Recently, the Service completed a range-wide baseline evaluation of  
    the spotted owl and its critical habitat based on data from  
    consultations completed from 1994 to the present (USDI 2001).  The  
    rangewide report is based on a year-long effort to better compile and  
    evaluate information reported in all BOs involving effects to the  
    spotted owl or its critical habitat that have been issued since 1994.  
    In brief, this evaluation finds that consulted-on effects regarding  
    the removal and downgrading of suitable spotted owl habitat are below  
    the 2.5 percent estimated by the NWFP to be removed from Federal lands  
    each decade, that not all consulted-on effects have actually occurred  
    on the ground as of this time, that the range-wide effects to critical  
    habitat are minimal, and that HCPs are generally providing demographic  
    support and/or connectivity with Forest Plan lands.  The report  
    concludes that effects consulted on from 1994 to present are  
    consistent with the assumptions for the first decade of the NWFP  
    implementation, as identified in the Service's 1994 BO, and that  
    effects to critical habitat do not impair its ability to contribute to  
    recovery of the owl across its range.  
  
    Habitat Conservation Plans (Rangewide)  
  
    The range-wide status of the spotted owl has been affected by a number  
    of recent HCPs that were prepared pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of  
    the Act.  
  
    Ten major and three smaller HCPs have been completed within the range  
    of the spotted owl in California, Oregon, and Washington.  Two HCPs in  
    California cover 380,500 acres of non federal lands and allow  
    incidental take of 52 spotted owl sites.  Three Oregon HCPs cover  
    302,106 acres and allow incidental take of 36 spotted owl pairs and  
    spotted owls associated with 22,000 acres of NRF habitat.  Seven HCPs  
    and one HCP amendment have been completed in Washington.  One HCP with  
    Washington Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) (USDI, 1998) covered  
    1.6 million acres and is discussed below.  Four of the HCPs and the  
    HCP amendment cover approximately 233,040 acres of private lands and  
    allow incidental take of 108 spotted owls in the short-term  
    (equivalent to 54 pairs or sites) and 10 spotted owls per decade until  
    the year 2093.  
  
    The typical HCP strategy has concentrated on providing dispersal  
    habitat rather than maintaining breeding owls within the HCP area.  
    The notable exceptions are the CRMW HCP, which provides protection of  
    owl habitat on about 90,500 acres, and portions of WDNR and Plum Creek  
    lands where demographic support or connectivity to federal lands is  
    needed.  For most HCPs, management actions will result in reduced  
    numbers of spotted owls over the short-term but will provide longer-  
    term habitat commitments and improved connectivity between federal  
    lands.  
  
    The WDNR incidental take permit for 1.6 million acres of State forest  
    land was approved on January 30, 1997.  The 70 year permit authorizes  
    incidental take resulting from commercial forest activities as well as  
    non-timber resource activities.  For spotted owls, the HCP provides  
    for the maintenance of designated NRF habitat for demographic support  
    adjacent to federal lands, and improved landscape conditions for  
    dispersal.  The HCP permits the following incidental take: 70 known,  
    15 projected unknown, and 36 potential future spotted owl pairs, young  
    and/or territorial singles in western Washington (excluding the  
    Olympic Experimental State Forest); 47 known, 16 projected unknown,  
    and 36 potential future spotted owl pairs, young and/or territorial  
    singles in eastern Washington; and up to 31 unknown spotted owl pairs,  
    young, and/or territorial singles as well as all owls associated with  
    future harvest of between 3,300 to 16,300 acres of suitable spotted  
    owl habitat per decade in the Olympic Experimental State Forest.  
    Disturbance-related take due to timber harvest activities may occur on  
    an average of 26,675 acres per year for the first decade of the HCP,  
    and on 1,060 acres per year due to non-timber resource activities.  
  
    The Seattle HCP, covering approximately 90,500 acres, will be managed  
    for northern spotted owls throughout the Cedar River Municipal  
    Watershed (USDI, 1999).  Potential key habitats for the northern  
    spotted owl in the watershed are primarily mature, late-successional,  
    and old-growth forests.  The HCP is expected to be a net benefit to  
    spotted owl populations in the Snoqualmie Pass area, as well as enable  
    movement of spotted owls north and south along the Cascade Mountains.  
    The number of owls expected to be taken is very small due to the level  
    of protection provided by the proposed HCP.  
  
    The original Plum Creek Cascades HCP (Plum Creek 1996) addressed about  
    170,600 acres (169,177 acres of Plum Creek ownership and about 1,400  
    acres of land for which Plum Creek reserved timber harvest rights) for  
    50-100 years in King and Kittitas Counties, Washington.  The Permit  
    allows incidental take of up to 83 known or projected future owl sites  
    over 100 years as a result of harm from habitat removal by timber  
    harvest and a minimal amount of harassment from disturbance due to the  
    seasonal restrictions on timber harvest and road construction.  
  
    The original Murray Pacific Corporation (Murray) HCP for owls was  
    completed in 1993.  Soon after the initial HCP was completed, Murray  
    discovered that they might have marbled murrelets on their property  
    and decided to develop a habitat based multi-species HCP for their  
    55,000 acre tree farm as an amendment to their original owl HCP.  On  
    October 29, 2001, West Fork Timber (previously Murray) requested that  
    the Service add the Puget Sound/Coastal bull trout Distinct Population  
    Segment and the Canada lynx to their Incidental Take Permit.  The  
    Service completed the BO and Statement of Findings for the addition of  
    these species on June 24, 2002.  The HCP addresses listed species, as  
    well as federal and state candidate species, to ensure that sufficient  
    amounts of the habitat types are maintained or enhanced for all  
    species that may occur on West Fork Timber's lands.  
  
    Spotted Owl Critical Habitat  
  
    Critical habitat serves to identify lands that are considered  
    essential for the conservation of a listed species.  As such, spotted  
    owl critical habitat was based upon the conservation principles  
    emphasized by the ISC strategy (Thomas et al. 1990) as represented by  
    the primary constituent elements of 1) suitable habitat to support  
    population clusters and 2) support for dispersal (USDI 1992a).  One  
    hundred and ninety critical habitat units (CHU), encompassing about  
    3.1 million acres of suitable owl habitat, were identified using owl  
    habitat maps available in the early 1990s.  CHUs were intended to  
    identify a network of habitats that provided the functions considered  
    important to maintaining a stable, self-sustaining, and interconnected  
    population over the owls' range with each CHU having a local,  
    provincial, and a range-wide role in owl conservation.  Most CHUs were  
    expected to provide suitable habitat for population support, while  
    some were designated primarily for connectivity (or both).  
  
    The Service's approach to designated critical habitat was based on the  
    expectation that a long-term plan would be developed to provide for  
    conservation of the owl.  The final rule designating critical habitat  
    (USDI 1992b) states that "Critical habitat is primarily intended to  
    identify the habitat that meets the criteria for the primary  
    constituent elements.  Designation will help retain recovery options  
    and reduce the near-term risk until a long-term conservation plan is  
    implemented."  The rule also states that "Designation of critical  
    habitat does not offer specific direction for managing owl habitat.  
    That type of direction will come ... through the development of land  
    management plans that address management of the owl."  The rule also  
    expressed the expectation that the primary scale of analysis for  
    evaluating project-related effects to critical habitat to determine if  
    the range-wide conservation goals are being met was the physiographic  
    province.  
  
    Since both the NWFP and critical habitat applied the same ISC  
    principles, and both efforts used similar habitat data and maps (with  
    slight improvements by 1994), it is not unexpected that the results of  
    identifying large blocks of habitat would be similar.  As such, the  
    Forest Plan's network of LSRs overlap critical habitat by about 70  
    percent along with owl habitat in other land use allocations and in  
    the matrix contributing to connectivity (and some population support).  
    Although the NWFP was designed using the ISC principles, it also  
    incorporated recommendations from the owl recovery team (USDI 1992b),  
    used better data, and was further strengthened to address the needs of  
    other late-successional forest-associated species.  Therefore, the  
    Service concluded in its 1994 BO on the NWFP (USDA/USDI 1994a) that  
    the reserve/connectivity strategy of that plan (as described in the  
    preceding sections) was a reasonable match for critical habitat and  
    would perform the habitat/dispersal functions of critical habitat.  
    The Service also concluded (as noted above) that the NWFP would  
    provide the basis for the Federal contribution to recovery of this  
    species.  The redundancy of function between critical habitat and the  
    NWFP reduces the significance of adverse effects to CHUs for this  
    species and, as a result, consultations conducted on critical habitat  
    since 1994 have considered effects to critical habitat in the context  
    of NWFP's ability to support the biological functions of the  
    constituent elements intended by the critical habitat designation.  
  
    ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE  
  
    Regulations implementing the Act (50 CFR section402.02) define the  
    environmental baseline as the past and present impacts of all federal,  
    state, or private actions and other human activities in the action  
    area.  Also included in the environmental baseline are the anticipated  
    impacts of all proposed federal projects in the action area which have  
    already undergone section 7 consultation, and the impacts of state and  
    private actions which are contemporaneous with the consultation in  
    progress.  Such actions include, but are not limited to, previous  
    timber harvests and other land-management activities.  The  
    environmental baseline for this action includes adoption of the NWFP,  
    and the issuance of certain section 10(a)(1)(B) permits.  Information  
    relevant to describing the environmental baseline for this action is  
    included in the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team report  
    (USDA et al. 1993), the NWFP Record of Decision, and BOs on the Final  
    SDEIS preferred alternative (USDI 1994) and the WDNR 10(a)(1)(B)  
    permit (USDI 1998).  
  
    The action area is defined to mean "all areas to be affected directly  
    or indirectly by the Federal action and not merely the immediate area  
    involved in the action."  For the purposes of this consultation, the  
    action area is defined as the ROW corridor plus a 200 foot buffer  
    distance into the forest along the edge of the corridor.  This  
    distance represents the area that is likely to be affected by wind  
    throw and other edge effects.  Danger trees may also be removed up to  
    200 feet from the edge of the power line corridor.  Effects to spotted  
    owls was evaluated out to a distance of 1.8 miles from the ROW  
    corridor.  In the Washington Cascades, a 1.8 mile-radius distance is  
    used to represent the mean annual home range size for spotted owls  
    (about 6,600 acres).  
  
    The action area is located just west of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie  
    National Forest and is within the I-90 area of concern.  Since 1994,  
    the Service has issued 12 BOs to the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National  
    Forest, five of which included removal, downgrading, or degradation of  
    suitable owl habitat for a net total of 173 acres removed or  
    downgraded.  In 1994, there were 176 known owl activity centers on the  
    Forest (G. Mayfield, pers. comm.).  The Cedar River HCP was completed  
    in 1999.  The incidental take permit issued for this HCP was  
    associated with minor stand management activities related to improving  
    habitat conditions for owls.  There are five documented spotted owl  
    activity centers within the CRMW.  
  
    The following Environmental Baseline discussion focuses on the current  
    condition of northern spotted owl habitat within the action area.  
  
    Owl Status within 1.8 miles of the Action Area  
  
    The action area consists of a mix of managed commercial timber lands  
    and protected forests within the CRMW and lies just south of  
    Interstate 90 near the community of North Bend (Figure 1).  There are  
    approximately 27,600 of forested acres within 1.8 miles of the  
    transmission line.  Primary landowners include the City of Seattle  
    (approximately 40 percent) and industrial forest companies  
    (approximately 50 percent).  WDNR and private lands make up the  
    remaining ownerships within 1.8 miles of the power line corridor.  
  
    The vast majority of suitable owl habitat is located in the City of  
    Seattle's CRMW HCP area.  The forests within the lower CRMW were  
    harvested approximately 75 to 90 years ago, resulting in approximately  
    11,000 acres which are currently typed as mature forest within the  
    action area (USDI, 1999).  Remnant patches of mature forests are also  
    found in the Raging River canyon and on state lands north of the CRMW.  
    The dominant tree species is Douglas fir, with an average diameter at  
    breast height (dbh) of 18 to 24 inches in the mature stands.  Private  
    timberlands consist of a patchwork of age classes, ranging from a few  
    small remnant patches old-growth to recent clearcuts.  The vast  
    majority of the commercial timber lands outside of the CRMW are not  
    suitable owl habitat and the southern end of the project terminates in  
    a rural interface area with little or no forested habitat.  
  
    The mature forest stands within the lower CRMW are considered suitable  
    roosting, foraging, and dispersal habitat for spotted owls.  Although  
    stands over 80 years old are starting to develop structural diversity,  
    they are generally not old enough to exhibit the complexity found in  
    old growth which is needed to provide nesting habitat for owls.  
    However, high-grade logging techniques often resulted in snags, cull  
    trees, and unmerchantable timber being left on site.  These scattered  
    remnants may provide nesting opportunities within an apparently  
    homogeneous stand.  Complicating the issue of potential nesting  
    habitat is the fact that there is a substantial degree of variation in  
    habitat structural development within stands that are essentially  
    equal in chronological age.  Depending on site conditions, mature  
    stands can develop late-successional forest characteristics at a  
    relatively early age.  
  
    Figure 2-Owl locations and Habitat within  
    the Action Area  
  
    There are several remnant patches of old growth forests within 1.8  
    miles of the project area that currently provide potentially suitable  
    nesting habitat for spotted owls.  The largest patch is located  
    approximately 1 mile from the power line and several stringers and  
    smaller patches are scattered throughout the riparian areas.  
  
    Calling surveys were initiated throughout the upper and lower portions  
    of the Cedar River Municipal Watershed during 1986-87 by University of  
    Washington graduate students and City of Seattle personnel in order to  
    determine the distribution of owls in the watershed.  Three spotted  
    owl responses were documented in the upper CRMW during these surveys.  
    The spotted owl responses represented a resident single male and one  
    reproductive pair located in the upper watershed, approximately 10  
    miles from the project area.  The adult male of the pair was radio-  
    tagged and tracked for approximately one year.  In addition to the  
    spotted owls found in the upper watershed, one barred owl activity  
    center was located approximately 2 miles east of the project area.  
  
    No further surveys or monitoring studies were conducted until 1990,  
    when calling surveys were re-initiated in selected areas of the upper  
    watershed.  The pair was relocated during these surveys and both  
    adults and a juvenile were banded and the old radio-transmitter was  
    removed from the male.  Two additional resident single sites were  
    located within the upper watershed during the surveys, but no more  
    reproductive pairs were found.  No surveys were conducted in the lower  
    watershed and the vicinity of the project site during this time.  
  
    In 1993 a single spotted owl of unknown status was located  
    approximately 0.5 miles east of the project site in the Raging River  
    watershed during surveys conducted by the WDNR.  All of the vocal  
    responses from this owl were within 1.8 miles of the transmission  
    line.  As of 2003, this single spotted owl and the barred owl located  
    in 1987 were the closest documented owl activity centers within the  
    action area.  
  
    Because owl information was very limited in the project area, the BPA  
    decided to initiate spotted owl surveys for the proposed action in  
    March of 2002.  Spotted owl surveys were conducted to protocol in the  
    spring of 2002 and 2003.  All suitable owl habitat within 1.8 miles of  
    the project was surveyed and no spotted owls were located.  One pair  
    of barred owls was located approximately 1 mile west of the project  
    area within a remnant patch of old growth.  Great horned owl and pygmy  
    owl responses were also documented in the action area. The historic  
    single site that was active in 1993 is currently below the 40 percent  
    threshold for habitat within the median annual home range and most of  
    the habitat at the site center has been logged.  Because no owls were  
    located during survey efforts in this area, it appears that the site  
    is no longer occupied.  
  
    Research studies over the past decade indicates that the invasion of  
    barred owls is causing displacement of spotted owls and an apparent  
    shift to higher elevations (Taylor and Forsman 1976, Hamer et al.  
    1989, Vincent 1990, Csuti et al. 1997, Kelly 2001, Gremel 2002,  
    Pearson and Livezey, in prep.).  Since no spotted owls were located,  
    the majority of the habitat in the action area is only marginally  
    suitable and is below 1500' elevation, and the best available nesting  
    habitat is occupied by a pair of barred owls, it appears that spotted  
    owls are not currently nesting in the action area.  As habitat  
    conditions in the CRMW improve and are capable of providing higher  
    levels of prey resources and nesting opportunities, it is anticipated  
    that the area will become more suitable for spotted owls in the  
    future.  At this time the upper watershed provides higher quality  
    nesting habitat, and spotted owl occurrence in the action area likely  
    is limited to dispersing juveniles and/or displaced adult spotted owls  
    that may move through the action area on occasion.  
  
    Effects of the Action on Northern Spotted Owls  
  
    In determining whether an action is likely to jeopardize a species,  
    the Service analyzes the effects of the action and the effects of  
    other activities that are interrelated or interdependent with that  
    action, in the context of the environmental baseline.  All actions are  
    evaluated against, and added to, the environmental baseline.  
  
    Direct Effects  
  
    The proposed action will result in the permanent removal of 87 acres  
    of potential roosting, and foraging habitat, of which 16 trees are  
    located within the median home range of the historic single owl site.  
    Because all but one of the 16 trees are alders and the taller trees  
    slated for removal are scattered throughout the riparian area, no  
    degradation of suitable owl habitat is expected.  Clearing the ROW  
    corridor will also remove approximately 35 acres of dispersal habitat  
    and younger stands.  
  
    In addition to the direct loss of suitable habitat, the ROW clearing  
    will double the width of the existing power line corridor and create a  
    9-mile long opening equivalent to the width of an average size  
    clearcut.  However, unlike clearcuts that spotted owls can, and do,  
    circumvent, there is no way around this permanent opening and spotted  
    owls must cross it to reach the other side.  Red-tailed hawks and  
    great horned owls utilize power line corridors and other forest  
    openings and are known to prey on spotted owls.  Because predators are  
    attracted to openings, the risk of predation to spotted owls that  
    cross open areas is higher than when they move through forested areas.  
  
    Research indicates that approximately 40 percent of adult and sub-  
    adult spotted owl mortalities in fragmented landscapes of the Pacific  
    Northwest are caused by avian predation, with great horned owls being  
    the primary predators (Forsman 1976, Forsman et. al. 1984, Miller and  
    Meslow 1985, Carey et al. 1990).  Studies have also documented  
    approximately 95 percent of great horned owl responses within 300 feet  
    of a forest opening (Johnson, 1993) and it has been hypothesized that  
    forest fragmentation and the associated increase in edge habitat may  
    contribute to an increased risk of predation on spotted owls (Thomas  
    et al. 1990).  The great horned owl responses documented during the  
    surveys for this project were all adjacent to forest openings.  
    Juvenile spotted owls experience extremely high mortality rates (USDI  
    1990a; Miller 1989) and are very vulnerable in their first year, as  
    indicated by a 23 percent survival rate.  Primary known causes of  
    mortality are starvation and predation by great horned owls (Miller  
    1989; USDI 1990a).  
  
    Studies on dispersing juvenile spotted owls show that they disperse in  
    random directions (Miller 1989 in Thomas et al. 1990), and that  
    dispersal direction was not correlated with landscape features such as  
    drainages or ridges (Gutierrez et al. 1985).  Average dispersal  
    distances for radio-collared juvenile owls ranged from 16 to 20 miles  
    for males and females respectively (Miller 1989) and they have been  
    documented up to 40 miles from their natal sites in Oregon (Thomas et  
    al. 1990).  As of 1998, there were 11  documented reproductive spotted  
    owl pair sites within 20 miles of the action area.  The proposed  
    action thus could contribute to owl mortality due to the potential  
    increased risk of predation on dispersing adults and juveniles that  
    must cross the power line clearing.  
  
    To estimate effects from predation, a quantitative estimate of the  
    probability and frequency of dispersing individuals that may encounter  
    the power line corridor was made based on the density and reproductive  
    potential of the surrounding known owl pair sites.  There are 11  
    documented reproductive spotted owl pair sites within 20 miles of the  
    project area (WDNR Heritage database).  This distance approximates the  
    average dispersal distance for juveniles (Miller 1989, Thomas et al.  
    1990).  Research indicates that, in any given year, approximately 62  
    percent of the owl sites are productive, with an average clutch size  
    of two juveniles (Forsman et. al 1984).  Because juvenile survival to  
    dispersal age is relatively low (23 percent), it is estimated that up  
    to 3 juveniles that are produced by the pair sites will survive to  
    dispersal age.  However, it is recognized that dispersal direction is  
    random and few owls are likely to be harmed or preyed upon as a direct  
    result of encountering the ROW corridor.  If one percent of the  
    juvenile owls from the surrounding pair sites are killed while  
    crossing the corridor, the Service estimates that approximately one  
    owl may be incidentally taken in the next 50 years (life of the HCP)  
    as a direct result of this project.  
  
    Disturbance  
  
    Because no spotted owls were located during the surveys, no adverse  
    effects are anticipated with project implementation, eliminating the  
    need for seasonal operating restrictions.  Helicopter fueling and  
    landing sites will be restricted to roads and landings within the  
    immediate vicinity of the action area and are not located within 0.25  
    miles of un-surveyed suitable spotted owl nesting habitat.  Since all  
    blasting activities are also contained within the survey areas, no  
    disturbance associated with the use of explosives is anticipated.  
  
    Indirect Effects  
  
    Clearing of the ROW corridor will affect interior forest and edge  
    habitats by removing 150 feet of trees along the entire 9 mile length  
    of the project.  Stands that are two or three tree lengths from the  
    ROW and are currently functioning as interior forest habitat will be  
    converted to edge.  Removing the wind firm mature trees along the  
    clearing will expose trees that have grown in the protected  
    environment of the stand.  It is highly probable that the trees along  
    the new edge will experience damage from wind throw and a certain  
    degree of stand unraveling likely will occur along the ROW during the  
    first few windstorms.  
  
    Clearing, and the associated increased edge effect, often causes  
    measurable effects on interior forest habitat and the remaining  
    stands.  For instance, changes in microclimate, such as temperature,  
    wind speed, and species composition, can be measured over 400 feet  
    into forests that are adjacent to openings (Chen 1990).  Spotted owls  
    exhibit a certain degree of temperature-sensitivity and are frequently  
    observed roosting close to the ground in cool draws on hot days and  
    conversely using roosts higher in the canopy and on southern aspects  
    on cold days (Forsman 1984, Thomas et al. 1990).  Research also  
    indicates that the level of fragmentation and heterogeneity increases  
    with distance from owl nest sites and is disproportionally lower  
    around nest and roost sites than at random sites, indicating a  
    preference for interior forest conditions and avoidance of edge  
    habitats for nesting and roosting (Hunter 1995).  
  
    Approximately 88 percent of the lower CRMW is currently classified as  
    mature forest habitat, most of it relatively un-fragmented.  Clearing  
    for the new transmission line will fragment a number of smaller mature  
    forest patches which currently do not function as interior habitat.  
    However, the project will also split a large mature forest block  
    (approximately 16,000 acres in size) into four smaller patches,  
    resulting in an increase in edge and decrease in interior forest  
    habitat.  In addition to widening the corridor, road construction  
    outside of the cleared ROW will lead to an approximate 13-acre  
    increase in edge habitat, all within the mid-seral conifer forest  
    type.  Although the level of fragmentation caused by the linear  
    opening is low, the indirect effects of increasing edge habitat in an  
    otherwise intact landscape may benefit species such as great horned  
    owls and barred owls that compete with, or prey on, spotted owls.  
  
    Since their range expansion into the Pacific Northwest over the past  
    40 years, anecdotal evidence suggests that barred owls may be  
    displacing northern spotted owls (Taylor and Forsman 1976, Hamer et  
    al. 1989, Vincent 1990, Csuti et al. 1997, Kelly 2001).  In the  
    Washington Cascades, barred owls are at least as numerous as spotted  
    owls (Hamer et al. 1989, Herter and Hicks 2000) and in many areas the  
    number of monitored spotted owl sites with barred owls has increased  
    annually since the early 1990s while the number of occupied spotted  
    owl sites has been decreasing.  The barred owl's increasing expansion  
    into the range of the spotted owl may eventually pose a serious threat  
    because barred owls use the same habitat as spotted owls, feed on a  
    much wider variety of prey (Hamer et al. 1989, Hamer et al., In  
    Press), hybridize with, and behave aggressively toward spotted owls  
    (Leskiw and Gutierrez 1998, T. Hamer, pers. comm., T. Fleming, pers.  
    comm).  
  
    Based on the survey data, it appears that barred owls are more common  
    in the lower watershed while spotted owls are restricted to the upper  
    basin.  Hamer (1988) and Hamer et al. (1989) conducted a  
    radiotelemetry study of northern spotted owls and barred owls in the  
    Cascades to analyze potential competition and habitat use overlap  
    between these two species.  Results of the study indicate that, while  
    both species utilize the same habitats, barred owl territories were  
    significantly smaller than spotted owl home ranges and many sites that  
    were historically occupied by spotted owls are now occupied by barred  
    owls.  Increasing fragmentation and actions that create openings  
    create habitat conditions that benefit barred owls, potentially  
    reducing the value of the area for spotted owls.  
  
    Beneficial Effects  
  
    To compensate for the permanent loss of mature forest habitat within  
    the CRMW, the BPA is proposing to transfer approximately 110 acres of  
    the Trillium Parcel to the City of Seattle.  About 61 acres of the  
    area to be transferred is currently old enough to provide roosting and  
    foraging habitat for spotted owls and will partially offset the  
    permanent loss of 87 acres of suitable habitat under the proposed  
    action.  Although the remaining area is currently not old enough to  
    provide owl habitat, it will be allowed to develop into habitat in the  
    future and will be protected from logging under the provisions of the  
    Cedar River HCP.  The BPA is also pursuing acquisition of a parcel  
    owned by Plum Creek Timber Company on the southern edge of the  
    watershed.  Transfer of 363 acres of this parcel to the City of  
    Seattle will also provide security from logging and ensure additional  
    owl habitat in the future.  If these proposed land exchanges go  
    through, the BPA will be providing a 4:1 compensation ratio to offset  
    the effects of the powerline on the CRMW.  
  
    Effects from Interrelated and Interdependent Actions  
  
    Regulations implementing the Act require that the Service consider the  
    effects of activities that are interrelated and interdependent to the  
    proposed action (50 CFR section 420.02).  The Act defines interrelated  
    and interdependent activities as those which are part of a larger  
    action and depend upon the larger action for their justification, and  
    interdependent activities as those projects which have no independent  
    utility apart from the action that is under consideration.  Both  
    interrelated and interdependent activities are assessed by applying  
    the "but for" test, which asks whether any action and its associated  
    impacts would occur "but for" the proposed action.  
  
    In addition to the construction of the power line and associated  
    access roads, the following interrelated and interdependent actions  
    would occur: 1) ROW and road maintenance and use; 2) log hauling; and  
    3) slash disposal.  
  
    1.  Road maintenance and use is interrelated to the construction of  
    the power line as well as long-term maintenance of the transmission  
    lines, towers, and ROW corridor.  However, public access within the  
    CRMW and the power line corridor is restricted and nearly all of the  
    roads are gated.  Road use on private timber lands is also restricted  
    but generally includes seasonal public access with permits.  Un-  
    permitted motorized ingress into the project area by the public is  
    most likely to occur during the hunting season.  Traffic is thus  
    limited to annual maintenance and periodic equipment monitoring and is  
    not considered a significant issue related to this project.  Because  
    of the low use, road maintenance is limited to managing surface runoff  
    and ensuring proper drainage.  Routine cleaning and minor repair of  
    culverts may need to be conducted after heavy storm events.  Culvert  
    replacements may occur after major flood events (once every 50 or 100-  
    years) or when the life expectancy of the pipe has been exhausted.  
  
    For safe and uninterrupted operation of a transmission line,  
    vegetation within the ROW would not be allowed to grow above a certain  
    height.  The BPA clearing and maintenance plan outlines specifications  
    for maintaining vegetation in the power line corridor.  No tall-  
    growing trees are allowed to mature inside the ROW except in deep  
    canyons where the lines span well above the tree tops.  Vegetation  
    management of the power line corridor is generally conducted every 3  
    to 5 years, as needed.  Brush is controlled manually using power saws,  
    tractor-mounted brush blades, and/or mowers.  Use of herbicides is  
    prohibited within the CRMW and only occurs as needed in other areas.  
  
    The Service recently completed a literature review to determine the  
    distances at which various human-caused noise produces significant  
    disturbance to spotted owls.  This effort was aimed at determining the  
    level of disturbance that is likely to result in adverse effects and  
    is being used to refine the standard 0.25 mile buffer distance that is  
    currently being applied to minimize disturbance to owls during the  
    nesting season.  
  
    Delaney (1999) found that spotted owls showed visible signs of  
    disturbance and flushed from noise associated with the operation of  
    heavy equipment and chainsaws at around 200 feet and overflights of  
    light aircraft at 350 feet.  His and other studies indicate that noise  
    levels between 45 and 55 decibels (dB) are sufficient to drown out  
    spotted owl alarm calls and causes them to flush (M. Mamone, pers.  
    com. 2002).  
  
    Currently there is no occupied suitable nesting habitat within 0.25  
    miles of the power line corridor.  However, the BO that was prepared  
    for the City assumed that the older stands would develop into suitable  
    habitat within the term of the HCP (50 years).  If the mature stands  
    become occupied in the future, then maintenance activities such as  
    chain saw brushing, road repairs using heavy equipment, or low level  
    helicopter operations could result in harm or harassment to owls.  The  
    BPA will thus need to evaluate the effects of their power line  
    maintenance program on spotted owls in the future.  
  
    2)  It is expected that most of the timber with commercial value will  
    be removed from the ROW and sold.  Approximately 120 truck loads would  
    be needed per mile to remove 87 acres of mature timber along the 9-  
    mile length of the corridor.  Since the clearing extends over such a  
    long distance, truck traffic associated with timber removal will be  
    limited to a few loads per day in any given area and is not expected  
    to contribute significantly to the overall heavy equipment traffic  
    associated with the construction portion of the project.  
  
    Not all of the trees that are felled within the ROW in the CRMW will  
    be sold.  Larger trees that are felled near or within riparian areas  
    will be left in place as recruitment of large woody material.  Smaller  
    diameter stems with limited commercial value likely will be left on  
    site and will provide habitat for small mammals and birds.  It is  
    likely that prey production within the power line corridor will  
    attract competitors such as great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, and  
    other avian predators resulting in potential increased interactions  
    between these species and spotted owls near the edge of the clearing.  
  
    3) Slash will be chipped and/or left on site.  No burning is permitted  
    within power line corridors and use of herbicides is prohibited within  
    the CRMW.  Thus the effects of this interrelated action are considered  
    to be negligible.  
  
    Cumulative Effects  
  
    Cumulative effects are defined in the implementing regulations of  
    section 7 of the Act as those effects of future state or private  
    activities, not involving federal activities, that are reasonably  
    certain to occur within the action area (50 CFR section402.02).  The  
    cumulative effects of future federal actions will be considered during  
    the section 7 consultations required for those actions, and therefore,  
    are not considered cumulative to the proposed action.  
  
    Approximately 60 percent of the land within the action area is owned  
    by the state, commercial timber companies, or private individuals.  It  
    is anticipated that timber harvest activities will continue on  
    relatively short rotations (average 40 to 60 years) or land types will  
    be converted to rural residential housing on these ownerships.  The  
    spotted owl is listed as endangered in the State of Washington.  The  
    Washington State Forest Practices Board has adopted a Spotted Owl Rule  
    (WAC 222-16-085) for all non-federal lands in Washington and all  
    timber sales on private lands must meet these rules, at a minimum.  
    There are ten designated Spotted Owl Special Emphasis Areas (SOSEA)  
    within the range of the owl in Washington State that provide  
    protection of 1,000 acre cores around spotted owl activity centers,  
    and maintains 40 percent suitable owl habitat within the median annual  
    home range radii.  The action area is located approximately 13 miles  
    west of the nearest designated emphasis area (I-90 West SOSEA).  Under  
    the state rule, only seasonal protection for spotted owls exist on  
    non-federal lands outside of the emphasis areas.  Because the project  
    is not within or near a SOSEA, the majority of forested lands within  
    the action area are not expected to be managed for, or contribute  
    significantly to, the recovery of spotted owls.  The Service  
    anticipates that spotted owl populations will continue to decline on  
    non-federal lands and up to one fifth of the population range-wide may  
    be lost if all of the unprotected suitable habitat on private lands is  
    harvested (USDI 1995).  
  
    CONCLUSION  
  
    After reviewing the current status of the northern spotted owl, the  
    environmental baseline for the action area, the effects of the  
    proposed Kangley-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project, and the  
    cumulative effects, it is the Service's biological opinion that the  
    Kangley-Echo Lake Transmission Line Project, as proposed, is not  
    likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the northern spotted  
    owl.  
  
    The proposed project will result in the permanent removal of 120 acres  
    of habitat that spotted owls need for nesting, roosting, foraging, and  
    dispersal now and in the future.  In addition, the project will double  
    the width of the power line corridor, increasing the risk of predation  
    to owls that must cross the opening now and in the future.  
  
    However, this project, as proposed, will not compromise the recovery  
    or survival of the species because (1) no spotted owls were located  
    within the action area during surveys conducted in 2002 and 2003,  (2)  
    the number of acres that will be harvested is small, (3) the trees  
    will be cut along an existing opening and are considered unsuitable  
    for nesting by spotted owls, and (4) purchase of the Trillium and Plum  
    Creek parcels will result in the transfer of approximately 473 acres  
    of land to the City of Seattle's CRMW.  
  
    INCIDENTAL TAKE STATEMENT  
  
    Section 9 of the Act and Federal regulation pursuant to section 4(d)  
    of the Act prohibit the take of endangered and threatened species,  
    respectively, without  special exemption.  Take is defined as "harass,  
    harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture or collect, or  
    to attempt to engage in any such conduct."  
  
      Harm is further defined by the Service to include significant  
    habitat modification or degradation that results in death or injury to  
    listed species by significantly impairing essential behavioral  
    patterns, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering.  
  
      Harass is defined by the Service as intentional or negligent actions  
    that create the likelihood of injury to listed species to such an  
    extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavior patterns which  
    include, but are not limited to, breeding, feeding or sheltering.  
  
    Incidental take is defined as take that is incidental to, and not the  
    purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity.  Under  
    the terms of section 7(b)(4) and section 7(o)(2), taking that is  
    incidental to and not intended as part of the agency action is not  
    considered to be prohibited taking under the Act provided that such  
    taking is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this  
    Incidental Take Statement.  
  
    AMOUNT AND EXTENT OF TAKE  
  
    The Service anticipates that incidental take of spotted owls will be  
    difficult to detect because finding a dead or impaired specimen is  
    highly unlikely for the following reasons: 1) the low likelihood of  
    finding injured or dead individuals 2) the potential for delayed  
    mortality; 3) the rapid rate of decomposition; and/or 4) removal by  
    predators or scavengers.  The Service has thus determined that the  
    exact number of individuals that may be taken by the loss of suitable  
    habitat and predation is "unquantifiable."  
  
    Based on the best information currently available on spotted owl use  
    of the project area, the Service anticipates harm to foraging or  
    dispersing spotted owls from increased risk of predation to  
    individuals that must cross the power line corridor.  Based on an  
    estimate of juvenile survival and dispersal, the Service anticipates  
    that up to one (1) individual spotted owl may be taken every 50 years  
    as a direct result of the project.  
  
    Under the management of the Cedar River HCP, the owl habitat that will  
    be removed under the proposed action would have been available for use  
    by owls for at least another 50 years.  The Service has thus  
    determined that the loss of 87 acres of suitable habitat is likely to  
    adversely affect spotted owls.  However, because the habitat is not  
    occupied, no take of individual owls is anticipated as a direct result  
    of the loss of habitat.  
  
    EFFECT OF TAKE  
  
    The Service has evaluated the potential effects of this project and  
    has determined that the level of incidental take of spotted owls  
    associated with the proposed Kangley-Echo Lake Transmission Line  
    Project is not likely to result in jeopardy to the species.  Please  
    refer to the effects section for a discussion of how the project will  
    impact the northern spotted owl.  
  
    REASONABLE AND PRUDENT MEASURES - TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
    The Service believes that the following reasonable and prudent  
    measures are necessary and appropriate to minimize the likelihood of  
    take of spotted owls from the implementation of the Kangley-Echo Lake  
    Transmission Line Project.  
  
    1.    Minimize the loss of suitable habitat for spotted owls, and  
  
    2.    Monitor project implementation and compliance with conservation  
          measures identified in the BA.  
  
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
  
    In order to be exempt from the prohibitions of section 9 of the Act,  
    BPA must comply with the following terms and conditions, which  
    implement the reasonable and prudent measures (RPM) described above  
    and outline required reporting/monitoring requirements.  These terms  
    and conditions are non-discretionary:  
  
    The following terms and conditions are required to implement RPM 1:  
  
    2.   All remnant old growth trees, snags, and large trees greater than  
         20 inches dbh or greater that are adjacent to the ROW and do not pose  
         a significant safety concern will be left standing.  
  
    3.   A minimum of 2 large (minimum 20 inches in diameter) down logs  
         per acre must be retained within the ROW corridor for the portion of  
         the project located within the CRMW.  
  
    4.   Allow tall growing trees to persist where the power line spans  
         riparian corridors well above tree top levels.  Tree topping shall be  
         used in place of felling whenever possible within riparian areas and  
         chasms where mature trees growing below the line pose little or no  
         risk.  
  
    The following terms and conditions are required to implement RPM 2:  
  
    1.   BPA shall submit an annual report to the Service that provides  
    information on how the reasonable and prudent measures were  
    implemented.  The report should include a description of the size,  
    quantity, and distribution of down woody material and trees that were  
    removed or retained under the safety tree requirements.  The report  
    shall be submitted to the Western Washington Office by December 31,  
    2003.  
  
    The Service will be notified within three (3) working days upon  
    locating a dead, injured, or sick endangered or threatened species.  
    Initial notification will be made to the nearest Service Law  
    Enforcement Office.  Notification will include the date, time, precise  
    location of the injured animal or carcass, and any other pertinent  
    information.  Care should be taken in handling sick or injured  
    specimens to preserve biological materials in the best possible state  
    for later analysis of cause of death.  In conjunction with the care of  
    sick or injured endangered or threatened species or preservation of  
    biological materials from a dead animal, the finder has the  
    responsibility to ensure that evidence associated with the specimen is  
    not unnecessarily disturbed.  Contact Service's Law Enforcement office  
    in Redmond at 425-883-8122 or the Western Washington Fish and Wildlife  
    Office at 360-753-9440.  
  
    While the incidental take statement provided in this consultation  
    satisfies the requirements of the Act, it does not constitute an  
    exemption from the prohibitions of take of listed migratory birds  
    under the more restrictive provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty  
    Act.  However, the Service will not refer the incidental take of any  
    migratory bird or bald eagle for prosecution under the Migratory Bird  
    Treaty Act of 1918, as amended (16 U.S.C. sections 703-712), if such  
    take is in compliance with the terms and conditions (including amount  
    and/or number) specified herein.  
  
    CONSERVATION RECOMMENDATIONS  
  
    Section 7(a)(1) of the Act directs federal agencies to utilize their  
    authorities to further the purposes of the Act by carrying out  
    conservation programs for the benefit of endangered and threatened  
    species.  Conservation recommendations are discretionary agency  
    activities to minimize or avoid adverse effects of a proposed action  
    on listed species or critical habitat, to help implement recovery  
    plans, or to develop information.  
  
    The following Conservation Measures are recommended to further reduce  
    impacts to spotted owls:  
  
    1.  If construction is delayed for several years, the Service  
        recommends that a site visit be conducted to the barred owl activity  
        center and best suitable nesting habitat to determine if spotted owls  
        may have re-occupied the area.  
  
    2.  Identify route alternatives and opportunities to minimize effects  
        of future power line expansion projects on listed or proposed species;  
  
    3.  BPA should consider land acquisition opportunities to mitigate for  
        the loss of habitat as a result of their actions in all areas where  
        power line projects cause permanent impacts to habitat for listed  
        species;  
  
    4.  The Service recommends modifications to the agency's current  
        right-of-way clearing and maintenance plan that allows for greater  
        flexibility in retention of large mature trees beyond the clearing  
        corridor and relaxes specifications requiring the removal of old  
        growth trees up to 200 feet from the power line corridor; and  
  
    5.  The Service recommends that standard design specifications for all  
        major perennial fish-bearing crossings should be aimed at maintaining  
        floodplain functions and riparian vegetation.  
  
    In order for the Service to be kept informed of actions minimizing or  
    avoiding adverse effects or benefitting listed species or their  
    habitats, the Service requests notification of the implementation of  
    these conservation recommendations.  
  
    REINITIATION - CLOSING STATEMENT  
  
    This concludes formal consultation on the action outlined in the  
    request for consultation.  As provided in 50 CFR section 402.16,  
    reinitiation of formal consultation is required where discretionary  
    federal agency involvement or control over the action has been  
    retained (or is authorized by law) and if: 1) the amount or extent of  
    incidental take is exceeded; 2) new information reveals effects of the  
    agency action that may affect listed species or critical habitat in a  
    manner or to an extent not considered in this BO; 3) the agency action  
    is subsequently modified in a manner that causes an effect to the  
    listed species or critical habitat not considered in this BO; or 4) a  
    new species is listed or critical habitat designated that may be  
    affected by the action.  In instances where the amount or extent of  
    incidental take is exceeded, any operations causing such take must  
    cease pending reinitiation.  
  
    The Service would like to commend the BPA for conducting surveys and  
    designing this project to minimize impacts to listed species,  
    including narrowing the ROW corridor to the greatest extent  
    practicable, minimizing the number of access roads required, and  
    modifying the maintenance standards and tower designs to retain more  
    mature trees within the riparian areas.  We also acknowledge the  
    extent to which the BPA is willing to compensate the City of Seattle  
    for effects to the Cedar River HCP with the proposed land acquisitions  
    and transfer actions.  
  
    We appreciate the assistance and cooperation of your staff and the BPA  
    throughout this consultation process.  If you have any questions  
    regarding this BO, please contact Martha Jensen at (360) 753-9000 or

    Re:  Kangley - Echo Lake Transmission Project  
  
    Preliminary Insurance Proposal  
  
    Dear Enrico:  
  
    We are pleased to provide an overview of the coverages available using  
    our Contractor's Pollution Liability - sudden and gradual insurance  
    coverage. We have listed some contingencies at the base of this letter  
    that must be addressed prior to coverage being bound.  
  
    You are hereby notified that pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance  
    Act of 2002 (the "Act") effective November 26, 2002, this proposal  
    includes insurance for loss arising from pollution incidents caused by  
    certain acts of terrorism.  Terrorism is defined as any act certified  
    by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of  
    State and the Attorney General of the United States, to be an act of  
    terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human  
    life, property or infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within  
    the United States, or outside the United States in the case of an air  
    carrier vessel or the premises of a United States Mission; and to have  
    been committed by an individual or individuals acting on behalf of any  
    foreign person or foreign interest, as part of an effort to coerce the  
    civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or  
    affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.  An  
    exclusion for "terrorism" that falls outside the definition contained  
    in the Act may still apply.

    Policy Term:  To address requests from the City of Seattle and the  
    Bonneville Power Administration for a policy term considering possible  
    delays arising out of litigation, we are offering the following  
    option:  
  
    1. Four year (48 month) policy term with no completed operations  
    extension with the following conditions:  
  
    * Construction Activities* will be limited to a 15 month period of  
    time exclusive of any interruption or delay due to litigation.

    be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is  
    dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure; to have resulted  
    in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in  
    the case of an air carrier or vessel or the premises of a United  
    States Mission; and to have been committed by an individual or  
    individuals acting on behalf of any foreign person or foreign

    disclosed above, otherwise we will avail ourselves of our normal  
    remedies for nonpayment of premium, including cancellation of your
