    AN ORDINANCE relating to Street and Sidewalk Use, amending Sections  
    15.17.005, 15.17.010, 15.17.050, and 15.17.080 of the Seattle  
    Municipal Code and adopting a new Street Use Permit Fee Schedule for  
    vending permits in the stadium area.  
  
    WHEREAS, Ordinance 120822, regulating street vending in public places  
    near Safeco Field and Seahawk Stadium, took effect in July 2002; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Seattle Transportation has monitored vending practices under  
    Ordinance 120822 and their effects on pedestrian and vehicular traffic  
    in the area; and  
  
    WHEREAS, with the exception of the regulated vending on foot of  
    newspapers, magazines, event programs and other such publications,  
    mobile vending has had a significant impact on pedestrian safety,  
    vehicular traffic, and stationary vending, and it has proved to be  
    impractical and ineffective to regulate mobile vending in the stadium  
    area; and  
  
    WHEREAS, rules and regulations are necessary to protect the traveling  
    public in the stadium area because the unregulated vending on foot of  
    newspapers, magazines, event programs, and other such publications  
    within the stadium area and No Vending Zone impacts pedestrian safety  
    and vehicular traffic by forcing people off the sidewalks and into the  
    street and prohibiting the free flow of people in and out of the  
    stadium; and  
  
    WHEREAS, vendors have expressed interest in vending for Seahawk  
    Stadium and Seahawks Exhibition Center events within the stadium area;  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, because vending is proposed for Seahawks Exhibition Center  
    events as well as events taking place in the Seahawk Stadium in  
    addition to football, it simplifies the permit process and saves time  
    and effort for vendors to require a monthly vending permit for all  
    stadium and exhibition center events throughout the year; and  
  
    WHEREAS, some changes to the new ordinance were requested by the  
    affected parties to address what we have learned in the first year of  
    this program; NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:

    Comments from Jan. '03 Street Vending Evaluation and Feedback Survey  
  
    * Seven vendors said there was "a lot of improvement" in street  
      vending problems after the new ordinance took effect in July 2002. Two  
      vendors said there was "some improvement" and two vendors said there  
      was "no improvement."  
  
    * Six vendors said mobile vendors were the "main source of problems"  
      in the area, two said they were the "only source of problems" and  
      three said mobile vendors "did not cause any problems in the area."  
  
    * Eight vendors said mobile vending should be "completely prohibited,"  
      two said they should be allowed to vend "without further  
      restrictions."  
  
    * Five vendors said the existing permit fees provide the "right amount  
      of inspection" needed, three said they "did not provide enough  
      inspection," and two said "too much inspection was provided."  
  
    * Nine vendors said they "do not support higher permit fees for  
      increased inspection," one said "increased inspection is not needed."  
  
    * Eight vendors said they support a simplified monthly permit system  
      even if it meant higher fees in some months. Two said they do not  
      support this proposal because they only vend for Mariners games, and  
      two had no opinion.  
  
    * Seven vendors said they support allowing vending for Exhibition  
      Center events, two did not support the proposal and two had no  
      opinion.  
  
    * When asked for additional comments, six vendors restated their  
      desire to prohibit mobile vending or voice additional complaints about  
      mobile vending violations.
