    AN ORDINANCE increasing the appropriation in the 2003 budget of the  
    Human Services Department by decreasing the appropriation in the  
    Reserve for Food Programs in the 2003 Finance General budget.  
  
    WHEREAS, in the 2003 budget the City Council appropriated $500,000 for  
    the Department of Finance General as a reserve for Food Programs in  
    the City of Seattle; and  
  
    WHEREAS, in making that appropriation the City Council approved a  
    budget proviso requiring release of the funds to be authorized by  
    Council by legislation and restricting the use of the $500,000 solely  
    for Food Programs; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City of Seattle currently invests in 26 food bank sites  
    and 16 emergency meal program sites throughout Seattle's  
    neighborhoods, one home grocery delivery service, a transportation  
    program, two food distribution programs and three systems  
    support/advocacy programs totaling more than $1.79 million annually,  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, in the current economic climate, the need for food assistance  
    has increased and is expected to increase in the foreseeable future,  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City Council recognizes both the need to immediately  
    increase the amount of food assistance available, particularly for  
    specific needs such as infant formula, culturally appropriate foods,  
    and other special dietary foods and necessary food  distribution  
    supplies, that are not part of the regular food donation stream, and  
    the need to increase the long term capacity of food assistance  
    programs to serve more people by investing in facilities,  
    infrastructure improvements, food preparation and other operational  
    equipment, and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Human Services Department has the expertise to conduct a  
    Request for Proposal process that will provide appropriate community  
    and stakeholder outreach and participation, and that will ask  
    potential recipients to describe how their proposal will result in  
    increased food available to recipients,   NOW THEREFORE,

    appropriated in this ordinance only through contracts resulting from a  
    Request for Proposal process, with appropriate community and  
    stakeholder outreach and participation.    The Human Services  
    Department is encouraged to keep the application process simple and  
    straightforward with a focus on how the applicant will use the funding  
    to increase the amount of food available to recipients and to allocate  
    the funds expeditiously.

    needs for foods not part of the regular food donation stream, (such as  
    infant formula and culturally appropriate foods), the ability of the  
    investment to leverage other fund sources, and the sustainability and  
    effectiveness of the requesting program.  
  
      Section 7.  The Human Services Department shall report to the City  
    Council's Housing, Human Services and Community Development Committee  
    on the results of the Request for Proposal process, after the  
    allocation contracts have been finalized, with a summary of how this  
    funding was used to increase the amount of food assistance.
