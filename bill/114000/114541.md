    A.  The provisions of this section apply exclusively to the short  
    subdivision of a lot in a single-family zone containing more than one  
    existing single-family dwelling unit.  
  
    B.  A lot in a single-family zone containing more than one existing  
    single-family dwelling unit may be divided in accordance with this  
    Chapter as long as each of the following conditions is satisfied:

    by permit or is eligible to be established as a nonconforming  
    development in accordance with Section 23.42.102, Establishing  
    nonconforming status;  
  
    2.  Each existing single-family dwelling unit was constructed prior to

    to the short subdivision.  In connection with such waiver or  
    modification, the Director may require access and parking easements as  
    conditions of approval of the short subdivision; and  
  
    5.  Each resulting lot conforms to all other development standards of  
    the zone unless the Director determines that the short subdivision  
    cannot be approved if such standards are strictly applied and  
    modification or waiver of some or all of such standards would further  
    the public interest.  If the Director makes such determination, then  
    the Director may waive or modify development standards, provided that:
