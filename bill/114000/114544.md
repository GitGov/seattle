    2.  Grantor shall retain the right to use the Easement Area as long as  
    such use does not interfere with the rights granted herein to Grantee.

    a.  Erect or maintain any buildings or structures within the Easement  
    Area; or  
  
    b.  Develop, landscape, or beautify the Easement Area in any way that  
    would unreasonably increase the costs to the Grantee of restoring the  
    Easement Area and any private improvements therein.  
  
    This Easement Agreement shall run with the land described herein, and  
    shall be binding upon the parties, their heirs, successors in interest  
    and assigns.  Grantor covenants that it is the lawful owner of the  
    Easement Area and that it has a good and lawful right to execute this  
    Easement Agreement.  
  
    By this conveyance, Grantor will warrant and defend the sale hereby  
    made unto Grantee against all and every person or persons, whomsoever,  
    lawfully claiming or to claim the same.  This conveyance shall bind  
    Grantor and assigns forever.

    THIS EASEMENT AGREEMENT (the "Easement Agreement") is made this _____  
    day of _______________, 2003 by and between THE CITY OF SEATTLE, a  
    municipal corporation of the State of Washington, acting by and  
    through Seattle Public Utilities ("Grantor") and the CITY OF RENTON, a  
    municipal corporation of the State of Washington ("Grantee") for and  
    in consideration of ten dollars ($10.00) and other good and valuable  
    consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby  
    acknowledged.  Grantor hereby conveys and quitclaims to Grantee a  
    perpetual, nonexclusive easement in, on, over and across the land  
    depicted in Attachment A (the "Easement Area") described as follows:  
  
    That portion of the 60-foot-wide City of Seattle East Side Supply Line  
    right-of-way (formerly known as the Mercer Island Pipeline right-of-  
    way) as condemned by Ordinance 84393 of said City of Seattle and  
    awarded in Verdict 2 of King County Superior Court Cause No. 486190,  
    lying south of the Cedar River and lying north of the South line of  
    the North half of the Southwest quarter of the Northeast quarter of  
    Section 21, Township 23 North, Range 5 East, W.M.,  
  
    situate in King County, Washington  
  
    for the purpose of ingress to and egress from Grantee's Cedar River  
    Spawning Channel Project (the "Project"), located as shown in  
    Attachment A, by Grantee, its officials, employees, agents, licensees,  
    contractors and consultants.  For such ingress and egress, Grantee  
    shall have the right to use, construct, operate, maintain, alter,  
    improve and replace the road presently existing in the Easement Area  
    (together with drainage and other appurtenances thereto, the "Road");  
    and, within the Easement Area, to trim, cut, fell and remove all  
    trees, underbrush, other vegetation, obstructions or structures that  
    create unreasonable obstacles to such ingress and egress. This  
    easement is granted subject to the following General Terms and Special  
    Terms:  
  
    GENERAL TERMS  
  
    1.  Grantor reserves to itself the right to use or occupy the Easement  
    Area or any portion thereof for any of its own purposes, not  
    inconsistent with the purpose for this Easement, including without  
    limitation the construction, installation, repair, replacement,  
    maintenance, operation of Grantor's water transmission pipelines,  
    related facilities or other Grantor improvements, and lateral  
    connections thereto.  Grantor shall not be liable or responsible for  
    any relocation, damage to or restoration of the Road, its  
    appurtenances or any other portion of the Easement Area that may be  
    caused or necessitated by, or result from any use or occupancy of the  
    Easement Area by Grantor, its employees, contractors, invitees or  
    agents.  
  
    2.  Grantor reserves to itself the right to temporarily close the  
    access road in the Easement Area to travel when necessary for  
    Grantor's operational needs; provided, that Grantor shall notify  
    Grantee in advance of any such work, except when an emergency exists.  
    If reasonably practical for the Grantor, Grantor will provide  
    substitute access within the Easement Area, if required by the  
    Grantee, in the event the access road is closed for a period longer  
    than 10 days.  
  
    3.  Grantor reserves to itself the right to grant easements, permits  
    or other use rights to parties other than Grantee that are not  
    inconsistent with Grantee's use of the Easement Area.  
  
    4.  Grantee's use of the Easement Area shall in no way interfere with  
    the present or future use thereof by Grantor.  
  
     5.  Grantee understands and agrees that this Easement Agreement  
    grants rights of ingress to and egress from the Easement Area only to  
    Grantee, its officials, employees, agents, licensees, contractors and  
    consultants, and not to members of the general public.  
  
    6.  Grantee, at its sole expense, shall be responsible for the  
    maintenance and safety of the Road. Grantee shall maintain the Road in  
    a safe and passable condition at all times, and to take such measures  
    as may be necessary to abate dust from traffic using the Road.  
  
    7.  Before the commencement of any improvement, change of grade,  
    substantial repair or replacement of the Road (each, a "Road  
    Improvement") by Grantee or its agents, employees or contractors,  
    Grantee shall deliver plans and specifications to Grantor's Seattle  
    Public Utilities (SPU) for review and approval or disapproval.  Such  
    plans shall indicate the permanent grade established and depth of  
    cover over any then-existing pipelines and other utilities, and shall  
    show the drainage pattern within the vicinity.  No Road Improvement  
    shall be undertaken without the prior written approval of the Director  
    of SPU, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  In addition, forty-  
    eight (48) hours notice shall be given to SPU prior to commencement of  
    any Road Improvement.  If an emergency arises, Grantee or its agents  
    shall immediately phone SPU at (206) 386-1800.  
  
    8.  All alterations, moving or adjusting of pipelines and/or other  
    Grantor facilities required by Road improvements undertaken by Grantee  
    shall be performed by Grantee, subject to Grantor's prior approval of  
    Grantee's plans for such work, at no cost to Grantor.  
  
    9.    Grantee shall be liable for and pay when due all taxes  
    (including without limitation leasehold excise tax), assessments and  
    fees imposed on Grantor or Grantee by reason of Road or on any  
    property interest created by this easement, and Grantee shall fulfill  
    all other fiscal obligations required by law.  
  
    10.  A.  All Grantee's operations or activities on or occupancy of the  
    Easement Area, including without limitation, any use or occupancy of  
    the Easement Area by any official, employee, agent, representative,  
    licensee, consultant, contractor, licensee, visitor or invitee of  
    Grantee, shall comply with all Environmental Laws (as defined in  
    section 10.B), including those governing, or in any way relating to,  
    any Hazardous Substance (as defined in section 10.C).  If Grantor's  
    property becomes contaminated as a result of actions hereunder by  
    Grantee, its officials, employees, agents, consultants, contractors,  
    representatives, licensees, invitees, or visitors, Grantee shall clean  
    up and remediate such contamination as necessary to bring the property  
    in compliance with Environmental Laws.  If Grantee does not so act in  
    a prudent and prompt manner, Grantor reserves the right, but not the  
    obligation, to act in place of Grantee and to take such action as  
    Grantor deems necessary to ensure compliance or to mitigate the  
    violation.  All costs and expenses incurred by Grantor in connection  
    with any such actions shall become immediately due and payable by  
    Grantee upon Grantor's presentation of an invoice therefor.

    "Environmental Law(s)" means any local, state or federal law,

    11.  Grantee shall indemnify Grantor as follows:  
  
    A.  Grantee shall release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless  
    Grantor, its officials, employees, agents, licensees, contractors,  
    consultants, invitees and representatives (collectively, the  
    "Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims, liens, demands,  
    actions, costs, losses, expenses, harm, damages, and liability of any  
    kind or character asserted or arising from, on account of, or in  
    connection with (i) Grantee's exercise of its rights or obligations  
    under this Easement Agreement, (ii)  the acts or omissions of Grantee  
    and its officials, employees, agents, consultants, contractors,  
    representatives, licensees, invitees, or visitors in or upon the  
    Easement Area or (iii) any damage to or failure of the Road resulting  
    in any damage or injury to any person or property; provided, however,  
    nothing herein shall require Grantee to so indemnify and hold harmless  
    Grantor to the extent of the negligence of Grantor, its officials,  
    employees, agents, consultants, contractors, representatives, invitees  
    or licensees.  
  
    B.  Grantee shall release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the

    employees, agents, licensees, contractors, consultants, invitees or  
    representatives.  
  
    C.  As between the parties and solely for the purpose of effectuating  
    the indemnities contained in subsections A and B of this section 10,  
    Grantee expressly waives any immunity, defense or protection that may  
    be granted to it under the Washington State Industrial Insurance Act,  
    Revised Code of Washington Title 51 or any other industrial insurance,  
    workers' compensation or similar laws of the State of Washington.  
    This section shall not be interpreted or construed as a waiver of  
    Grantee's right to assert any such immunity, defense or protection  
    directly against any of its own employees or such employee's estate or  
    other representatives.  This section 10.C has been mutually negotiated  
    by the parties.

    12.  Grantee shall not assign its rights or obligations hereunder  
    except with the prior written consent of Grantor, which consent shall  
    not unreasonably be denied.  Subject to the preceding sentence, the  
    rights and obligations of Grantor and Grantee shall inure to the  
    benefit of and be binding upon their respective successors and  
    assigns. Should it be necessary for the United States, acting by and  
    through the Seattle District, United States Army Corps of Engineers,  
    to provide operation or maintenance on the Project due to the failure  
    of the Grantee to provide required operation or maintenance, then in  
    that event on behalf of the Grantee, the United States may use this  
    easement, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, with  
    the exception of indemnification obligations, and subject to  
    compliance by the United States with all state and local laws, rules  
    and regulations not in conflict with federal law; provided that the  
    Grantor may proceed against the United States under the Federal Tort  
    Claims Act or other applicable federal law for any damage the United  
    States may cause or for any breach of the obligations of the United  
    States hereunder.  
  
    13.  This Easement Agreement and all of Grantee's rights hereunder  
    shall terminate in the event that (i) Grantee ceases to use the  
    Easement Area for a period of three (3) years or other mutually agreed  
    upon time or (ii)  Grantee is in default of its obligations hereunder,  
    does not commence a cure within thirty (30) days of Grantor's notice  
    of such default, and does not proceed with diligence to cure such  
    default. The Grantor shall provide written notice to the United States  
    of any action or failure to act on the part of the Grantee that would  
    give rise to termination of this Easement Agreement 120 days prior to  
    termination. Notwithstanding any provision of this Easement Agreement  
    to the contrary, no termination of this easement will occur if the  
    Grantee or the United States is utilizing reasonable efforts to cure  
    the non compliance with the easement terms. In the event of  
    termination of this Easement Agreement and upon Grantor's request,  
    Grantee shall execute and record a Release of Easement Agreement. No  
    termination of this Easement shall release Grantee or Grantor from any  
    liability or obligation (including without limitation Grantee's  
    obligations under section 10) with respect to any matter occurring  
    prior to such termination.  
  
    SPECIAL TERMS:  
  
    1. Grantee will be responsible for locking the right-of-way gates upon  
    entering and exiting the Easement Area.  
  
    2. All vehicles are restricted to H-20 loading.  Except for passenger  
    vehicles, 1-inch steel plating will be required for construction  
    equipment or vehicles crossing over, or within 10-feet, of the

    review and approve for crossing protection, equipment to be used, and  
    how the equipment will be used within the East Side Supply Line right  
    of way.  
  
    3. Grantor authorizes and Grantee agrees to provide law enforcement  
    for the Easement area.  
  
    4. Grantor authorizes and Grantee agrees to clean-up debris and
