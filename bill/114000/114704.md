    AN ORDINANCE relating to building and construction codes: repealing  
    Section 22.300.015 of the Seattle Municipal Code (Ordinance 119507),  
    and adopting a new Section 22.300.016 to adopt the 2002 National  
    Electrical Code with Seattle amendments as the Seattle Electrical  
    Code.  
  
    WHEREAS, Chapter 19.28, Revised Code of Washington grants local  
    jurisdictions the authority to adopt regulations applicable to  
    electrical installations that differ from regulations adopted by the  
    state; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Mayor and City Council of the City of Seattle affirm the  
    findings of the Department of Planning and Development, as set forth  
    in Exhibit A, that the 2003 Seattle Electrical Code provides an equal,  
    higher, or better standard of construction and an equal, higher, or  
    better standard of materials, devices, appliances, and equipment than  
    the regulations adopted by the Washington State Department of Labor  
    and Industries amending the 2002 National Electrical Code, as set  
    forth at Chapter 296-46B Washington Administrative Code; NOW,  
    THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
      Section 1.  Section 22.300.015 of the Seattle Municipal Code  
    adopting the 1999 National Electrical Code as adopted in Ordinance  
    119507 is hereby repealed, and a new Section 22.300.016 is added to  
    the Seattle Municipal Code to read as follows:  
  
    22.300.016  Adoption of the National Electrical Code.  
  
      The National Electrical Code, 2002 edition, published by the  
    National Fire Protection Association, one copy of which is filed with  
    the City Clerk in C.F.306325, is hereby adopted and by this reference  
    made a part of this subtitle.  The National Electrical Code, 2002  
    edition, together with the amendments and additions thereto adopted by  
    this ordinance, constitute the Seattle Electrical Code.  
  
      Section 2.  The National Electrical Code, 2002 edition, is amended  
    by adding Chapters 1, 2 and 3 as follows:  
  
    CHAPTER 1  
  
    APPLICATION OF THIS CODE  
  
    Section 101 Title.  This code shall be known as the "Seattle  
    Electrical Code Supplement" or "Seattle Electrical Code" and may be so  
    cited.  It is referred to herein as the "Electrical Code" or "this  
    code."  
  
    Section 102.1 Purpose.  The purpose of this code is to promote public  
    safety in a practical manner from hazards arising from the use of  
    electricity.  This code is intended to provide for and promote the  
    health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not to create or  
    otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of  
    persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the  
    terms of this code.  This code is not intended as a design  
    specification nor an instruction manual for untrained persons.  
  
    Section 102.2 Chapter 296-46B Washington Administrative Code.  An  
    additional purpose of this code is to provide equal, higher or better  
    standards of construction and/or equal, higher or better standards of  
    materials, devices, appliances and equipment than that required by the  
    State of Washington under the provisions of Chapter 19.28 RCW (Revised  
    Code of Washington).  Those sections of the Washington State  
    Electrical Code amending the National Electric Code, as set forth at  
    Chapter 296-46B of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), are  
    adopted except those sections that are amended by or are in conflict  
    with this code.  The following administrative sections of Chapter 296-  
    46B WAC are superseded by this code:  WAC 296-46B-010 (1) - (13),  
    (15), (16), (19), (20), (23), (24); and WAC 296-46B-030.  
  
    Section 103 Scope.  The Electrical Code shall apply to all electrical  
    wiring and equipment, including communications systems, installed or  
    used within the City.  
  
    Exception No. 1:  Installations in ships and watercraft not connected  
    to public utilities, railway rolling stock, aircraft or automotive  
    vehicles.  
  
    Exception No. 2:  Installations of railways or generation,  
    transformation, transmission or distribution of power used exclusively  
    for operation of rolling stock or installations used exclusively for  
    signaling and communication purposes.  
  
    Exception No. 3:  Installations of communication equipment under  
    exclusive control of communication utilities, located outdoors or in  
    building spaces used exclusively for such installations.  
  
    Exception No. 4:  Installation of communication or signaling equipment  
    used exclusively for the operation of a municipal fire alarm or police  
    telegraph system.  
  
    Exception No. 5:  Installations under the exclusive control of  
    electric utilities for the purpose of communication, metering or for  
    the generation, control, transformation, transmission and distribution  
    of electric energy located in buildings used for such purposes or  
    leased by the utility or on public highways, streets, roads or other  
    public ways, or outdoors on established rights on private property up  
    to service point as defined in this code.  The installation and  
    maintenance of all service conductors up to the point of connection to  
    the consumer's service entrance conductors shall be the responsibility  
    of the serving utility.  
  
    Section 104  APPLICATION TO EXISTING BUILDINGS  
  
    (A) Additions, Alterations and Repairs. Additions, alterations and  
    repairs may be made to the electrical system of existing buildings or  
    structures without making the entire electrical system comply with all  
    of the requirements of this code for new buildings or structures,  
    provided the additions, alterations or repairs that are made shall  
    comply with the requirements of this code.  This section does not  
    limit the effect of applicable retroactive ordinances.  
  
    Exception:  Subject to the approval of the building official, repairs  
    may be made with the same materials of which the building or structure  
    is constructed, other than for the replacement of receptacles as  
    provided in NEC Section 406.3(D), provided the repair complies with  
    the electrical code in effect at the time of original installation and  
    provided further that no change shall be permitted which increases its  
    hazard.  
  
    (B) Existing Electrical Systems.  Electrical systems in existence at  
    the time of the passage of this code may continue to be used provided  
    such use was legal at the time of the passage of this code and  
    provided continued use is not detrimental to public safety.  
  
    (C) Maintenance.  All buildings or structures, both existing and new,  
    and all parts thereof shall be maintained in a safe condition.  All  
    devices or safeguards required by this code or by a code in effect  
    when the building or structure was erected, altered or repaired shall  
    be maintained in good working order.  The owner or the owner's agent  
    shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings and structures.  
  
      It shall be the duty of the owner or the owner's agent to maintain  
    in a safe and usable condition all parts of buildings or equipment  
    that are intended to assist in the extinguishing of fire, or to  
    prevent the origin or spread of fire, or to safeguard life or  
    property.  It shall be unlawful to fail to comply with any notice or  
    order of the fire chief or the building official.  
  
    Exception:  The building official may modify the requirements of this  
    subsection where all or a portion of a building is unoccupied.  
  
    (D) Historic Buildings and Structures.  The building official may  
    modify the specific requirements of this code as it applies to  
    buildings and structures designated as landmarks of historical or  
    cultural importance and require in lieu thereof alternate requirements  
    that, in the opinion of the building official, will result in a  
    reasonable degree of safety to the public and the occupants of those  
    buildings.  
  
      A historic building or structure is one that has been designated for  
    preservation by City Landmarks Preservation Board or the State of  
    Washington; has been listed, or has been determined eligible to be  
    listed, in the National Register of Historic Places; has been  
    officially nominated for such status, or is a structure contributing  
    to the character of a designated landmark or special review district.  
  
    (E) Moved Buildings.  Buildings or structures moved into or within the  
    city shall comply with standards adopted by the building official.  No  
    building shall be moved into or within the City unless, prior to  
    moving, the building official has inspected the building for  
    compliance with those standards and the permit holder has agreed to  
    correct all deficiencies found and has been issued an electrical  
    permit for the work.  Any moved building that is not in compliance  
    with those standards within one year from the date of permit issuance  
    and is found to be a public nuisance may be abated.  
  
      Buildings wired by standards other than those recognized by this  
    code and the National Electrical Code are not in compliance with these  
    provisions.  
  
    Section 105 Tests.   Whenever there is insufficient evidence of  
    compliance with the provisions of this code or evidence that any  
    material or construction does not conform to the requirements of this  
    code, the building official may require tests to be made, at no  
    expense to the City, as proof of compliance.  
  
      Test methods shall be specified by this code or by other recognized  
    test standards.  If there are no recognized and accepted test methods  
    for the proposed alternate, the building official shall determine the  
    test procedures.  
  
      All tests shall be made by an approved agency.  The building  
    official shall retain reports of tests.  
  
    Section 106 Utilization Equipment and Alternate Materials and Methods  
    of Wiring.  This code does not prevent the use of any utilization  
    equipment, material, method or design of wiring not specifically  
    allowed or prohibited by this code, provided the same has been  
    approved and its use authorized by the building official.  
  
    The building official may approve an alternate, provided he/she finds  
    that the proposed alternate complies with the provisions of this code  
    and the alternate, when considered together with other safety features  
    or relevant circumstances, will provide at least an equivalent level  
    of strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, safety and  
    sanitation.  
  
    The building official may require that sufficient evidence or proof be  
    submitted to substantiate any claims regarding the use or suitability  
    of utilization equipment, material, method or design of wiring.  The  
    building official may, but is not required to, record the approval of  
    alternate materials and methods, and any relevant information in the  
    files of the building official or on the approved permit plans.  This  
    section supersedes the requirements of WAC 296-46B-030.  
  
    Section 107 Modifications.  The building official may grant  
    modifications for individual cases whenever there are practical  
    difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of this code.  
    The building official must first find that the strict application of  
    this code is impractical under the circumstances and that the  
    modification is in conformity with the intent and purpose of this code  
    and does not lessen any fire protection requirements or any degree of  
    structural integrity.  The building official may, but is not required  
    to, record the approval of modifications and any relevant information  
    in the files of the building official or on the approved permit plans.  
  
    CHAPTER 2  
  
    ORGANIZATION AND ENFORCEMENT  
  
    Section 201 Authority.  Whenever the term or title "Authority Having  
    Jurisdiction," "Administrative Authority," "Responsible Official,"  
    "Building Official," "Chief Inspector" or "Code Enforcement Officer"  
    is used in this code, it shall be construed to mean the Director of  
    the Department of Planning and Development, and his or her designees.  
  
    Section 202 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BUILDING OFFICIAL  
  
    (A) General.  The building official is authorized and directed to  
    interpret and enforce the provisions and intent of this code.  
  
      Compliance with the requirements of this code shall be the  
    obligation of the owner of the building, structure or premises, the  
    duly authorized agent of the owner, or other person responsible for  
    the condition or work, and not of the City or any of its officers or  
    employees.  
  
    (B) Deputies.  The building official may appoint such officers,  
    inspectors, assistants and other employees as shall be authorized from  
    time to time.  The building official may deputize such employees as  
    may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Department of  
    Planning and Development.  
  
    (C) Right of Entry.  With the consent of the owner or occupier of a  
    building or premises, or pursuant to a lawfully issued warrant, the  
    building official may enter a building or premises at any reasonable  
    time to perform the duties imposed by this code.  
  
    (D) Stop Orders.  Whenever any installation, alteration, repair or  
    removal of electrical work is being done contrary to the provisions of  
    this code, or in the event of dangerous or unsafe conditions related  
    to electrical work, the building official may order the affected work  
    stopped and a notice describing the violation in writing posted on the  
    premises or served on any person responsible for the condition or  
    work.  It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in or cause any  
    further work to be done until authorization from the building official  
    is received.  
  
    (E) Authority to Disconnect Utilities.  The building official shall  
    have the authority to disconnect or order discontinuance of any  
    utility service or energy supply to buildings, structures or equipment  
    therein regulated by this code in cases of emergency or where  
    necessary for general public safety. The building official may enter  
    any building or premises to disconnect utility service or energy  
    supply.  Utility service shall be discontinued until the equipment,  
    appliances, devices or wiring found to be defective or defectively  
    installed are removed or restored to a safe condition.  
  
      It shall be unlawful for any person to reconnect any electrical  
    equipment that has been disconnected by the building official until  
    the equipment has been placed in a safe condition and approved by the  
    building official.  
  
    (F) Liability.  Nothing contained in this code is intended to be, nor  
    shall be construed to create or form the basis for any liability on  
    the part of the City or its officers, employees or agents, for any  
    injury or damage resulting from the failure of a building to conform  
    to the provisions of this code, or by reason or in consequence of any  
    inspection, notice, order, certificate, permission or approval  
    authorized or issued or done in connection with the implementation or  
    enforcement of this code, or by reason of any action or inaction on  
    the part of the City related in any manner to the enforcement of this  
    code by its officers, employees or agents.  
  
      Neither the building official nor any employee charged with the  
    enforcement of this code shall be personally liable for any damage  
    that accrues to persons or property as a result of any act or omission  
    committed in the discharge of their duties, provided that the building  
    official or employee acted in good faith and without malice.  
  
    (G) Code Interpretation or Explanation.  Electrical inspectors may  
    give information as to the meaning or application of the National  
    Electrical Code and the Seattle Supplement, but shall not lay out work  
    or act as consultants for contractors, owners or users.  
  
    (H) Cooperation of Other Officials and Officers.  The building  
    official may request, and shall receive so far as may be necessary in  
    the discharge of duties, the assistance and cooperation of other  
    officials of the City of Seattle and officers of public and private  
    utilities.  
  
    Section 203 Unsafe Conditions.  The building official may inspect any  
    new or existing electrical installation or equipment, and if the  
    installation or equipment is found to be maintained or used in an  
    unsafe condition or found to be in violation of this code, the  
    building official is authorized to serve upon the owner or user a  
    notice or order requiring correction.  Any person served such notice  
    who fails to comply with the order therein shall be in violation of  
    this ordinance and subject to the penalties provided in this code.  
  
      Whenever the building official finds that any building or structure,  
    or portion thereof, is in such a dangerous and unsafe condition as to  
    constitute an imminent hazard to life or limb, the building official  
    may issue an emergency order directing that the building or structure,  
    or portion thereof, be restored to a safe condition.  The order shall  
    specify the time for compliance. The order may also require that the  
    building or structure, or portion thereof, be vacated within a  
    reasonable time, to be specified in the order.  In the case of extreme  
    danger, the order may specify immediate vacation of the building or  
    structure, or may authorize disconnection of the utilities or energy  
    source pursuant to Section 202(E).  No person shall occupy the  
    building or structure, or portion thereof, after the date on which it  
    is required to be vacated until it is restored to a safe condition as  
    required by the order and this code.  It shall be unlawful for any  
    person to fail to comply with an emergency order issued by the  
    building official.  
  
    Section 204 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES  
  
    (A) Violations.  It shall be a violation of this code for any person,  
    firm or corporation to erect, construct, enlarge, repair, move,

    building or structure in the City, contrary to or in violation of any  
    of the provisions of this code.  
  
      It shall be a violation of this code for any person, firm or

    otherwise procure another to violate or fail to comply with any of the  
    provisions of this code.  
  
      It shall be a violation of this code for any person, firm or

    (B) Notice of Violation.  If after investigation the building official  
    determines that standards or requirements of this code have been  
    violated, the building official may serve a notice of violation upon  
    the owner or other person responsible for the action or condition.  
    The notice of violation shall state the standards or requirements  
    violated, shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to  
    comply with the standards or requirements, and shall set a reasonable  
    time for compliance.  The notice shall be served upon the owner or  
    other responsible person by personal service, certified mail with  
    return receipt requested or registered mail with return receipt  
    requested or registered mail addressed to the last known address of  
    such person.  In addition, a copy of the notice may be posted at a  
    conspicuous place on the property.  The notice of violation shall be  
    considered an order of the building official.  Nothing in this  
    subsection shall be deemed to limit or preclude any action or  
    proceeding pursuant to this code, and nothing in this section shall be  
    deemed to obligate or require the building official to issue a notice  
    of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties in  
    this section.  
  
    (C) Civil Penalty.  Any person, firm or corporation failing to comply  
    with the provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative  
    civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each  
    violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until  
    compliance is achieved.  
  
    (D) Criminal Penalties.  
  
      (1) Anyone violating or failing to comply with any order issued by  
    the building official pursuant to this code shall, upon conviction  
    thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by  
    imprisonment for not more than 360 days, or by both such fine and  
    imprisonment.  Each day's violation or failure to comply shall  
    constitute a separate offense.  
  
      (2)  Anyone violating or failing to comply with any of the  
    provisions of this code and who within the past five years has had a  
    judgment against them pursuant to Section 204(B), shall upon  
    conviction thereof be fined in a sum not to exceed $500 or by  
    imprisonment for not more than 180 days, or by both such fine and  
    imprisonment.  Each day's violation or failure to comply shall  
    constitute a separate offense.  
  
    (E) Additional Relief.  The building official may seek legal or  
    equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any  
    condition that constitutes a violation of this code when civil or  
    criminal penalties are inadequate to effect compliance.  
  
    Section 205 Notices.  It shall be unlawful for any person to remove,  
    mutilate, destroy or conceal any lawful notice issued or posted by the  
    building official pursuant to the provisions of this code.

    (C) Advance Plan Examination.  An architect or engineer registered in  
    the State of Washington may apply for an electrical permit and may  
    request an advance plan examination of electrical plans where the  
    electrical contractor has not yet been selected. Upon submission of an  
    application including required plans, and payment of fifty percent of  
    the estimated permit fee, the Department will review the application.  
    When the application and plans are found to be in compliance with the  
    Seattle Electrical Code, the Department will approve the application  
    and plans as ready for issuance.  Neither the permit nor the plans  
    shall be issued until the remainder of the fee is paid and the  
    electrical contractor's name and license number is placed on the  
    permit.  
  
    Section 303 PERMITS  
  
    (A) Issuance.  
  
      (1) General.  The application and plans filed by an applicant for a  
    permit shall be checked by the building official.  Such plans may be  
    reviewed by other departments of the City to check compliance with the  
    laws and ordinances under their jurisdiction.  If the building  
    official finds that the work as described in an application for permit  
    and the plans filed therewith conforms to the requirements of this  
    code and other pertinent laws and ordinances and that the fees  
    specified in the Fee Subtitle have been paid, the building official  
    shall issue a permit to the applicant who becomes the permit holder.  
    The building official may refuse to issue an electrical permit to any  
    person who refuses or fails to complete the work permitted by an  
    existing permit(s) on the same building or premises.  
  
    Exception No. 1:  The building official may issue a permit for the  
    installation of part of the electrical system of a building or  
    structure before complete plans for the whole building or structure  
    have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and  
    detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent  
    requirements of this code.  Holders of such permits may proceed at  
    their own risk without assurance that the permit for the entire  
    building or structure will be granted.  
  
    Exception No. 2:  A permit may be issued for work to commence prior to  
    the approval of plans, if such approval is delayed beyond 10 working  
    days after the plans have been submitted for examination.  The holders  
    of such permits may proceed at their own risk, with the understanding  
    that any work undertaken prior to approval of plans shall be done in  
    accordance with the provisions of this code and in accordance with the  
    plans as subsequently approved.  
  
      (2) Compliance with Approved Plans and Permit.  When issuing a  
    permit, the building official shall endorse the permit in writing and  
    endorse in writing or stamp the plans APPROVED. Approved plans shall  
    not be changed, modified or altered without authorization from the  
    building official, and all work shall be done in accordance with the  
    approved plans, except as the building official may require during  
    field inspection to correct errors or omissions.  
  
      (3) Amendments to the Permit.  When substitutions and changes are  
    made during construction, approval shall be secured prior to  
    execution; however, the electrical inspector may approve minor  
    modifications to the plans for work not reducing the fire and life  
    safety of the structure.  Substitutions, changes and clarifications  
    shall be as shown on two sets of plans that shall be submitted to the  
    building official, accompanied by redesign fees, prior to occupancy.  
    These changes shall conform to the requirements of this code and other  
    pertinent laws and ordinances.  
  
      (4) Requirement for License.  No electrical permit shall be issued  
    to an applicant who is engaging in, conducting or carrying on the  
    business of installing wires or equipment to convey electric current  
    or of installing apparatus to be operated by electric current unless  
    the applicant possesses a valid State of Washington license as  
    required by RCW 19.28.  The licensed installer responsible for the  
    work shall be identified on the electrical permit.  
  
    Exception:  Persons not possessing a license may obtain an electrical  
    permit in order to do electrical work at a residence, farm, place of  
    business or other property that they own as described in RCW  
    19.28.261.  
  
      (5) Cancellation of Permit Application.  If a permit is not issued  
    after a period of sixty days from the date of approval for issuance or  
    if corrections are not received after a period of sixty days from the  
    date of notification of required corrections, the building official  
    may initiate cancellation procedures.  Prior to cancellation, the  
    building official shall notify the applicant that the permit  
    application will expire and shall be canceled after 30 days.  After  
    the applicant has been notified, the site may be inspected to verify  
    that no work has taken place. The application shall be canceled 30  
    days after notice has been sent to the applicant, and it and any  
    accompanying plans and specifications destroyed and the portion of the  
    fee paid forfeited.  Upon written request of the applicant, the  
    building official may extend the life of the permit application for a  
    period not to exceed six months, with no further extensions possible,  
    except that applications may be further extended by the building  
    official where permit issuance is delayed by litigation, appeals or  
    similar problems.  
  
    (B) Retention of Plans and Permits.  One set of approved plans, which  
    may be on microfilm, shall be retained by the building official.  One  
    set of approved plans shall be returned to the applicant and shall be  
    kept at the site or the building or work at all times during which the  
    work authorized thereby is in progress.  The plans shall be available  
    at the site of the work or installation for use by inspection  
    personnel at all times. The permit issued by the building official  
    shall be kept posted on the premises at all times during the course of  
    the installation or work.  
  
    (C) Validity.  The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of  
    plans shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of,  
    any violation of any of the provisions of this code or any other  
    ordinance.  No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel  
    the provisions of this code shall be valid, except insofar as the work  
    or use it authorizes is lawful.  
  
      The issuance of a permit based upon plans shall not prevent the  
    building official from later requiring the corrections of errors in  
    the plans.  The issuance of a permit based upon plans shall not be  
    construed as permitting violations of this code or of any other  
    ordinance of the City.  
  
      The issuance of an electrical permit shall not prevent the building  
    official from requiring correction of conditions found to be in  
    violation of this code or any other ordinance of the City.  The period  
    of time for which a permit is issued shall not be construed to extend  
    or otherwise affect any period of time for compliance specified in any  
    notice or order issued by the building official or other  
    administrative authority requiring the correction of any such  
    conditions.  
  
    (D) Expiration and Renewal.  
  
      (1) Expiration.  Permits and renewed permits shall expire one year  
    from the date of issuance.  
  
    Exception No.1:  Initial permits for major construction projects that  
    require more than one year to complete, according to a construction  
    schedule submitted by the applicant, may be issued for a period that  
    provides reasonable time to complete the work but in no case longer  
    than three years.  
  
    Exception No.2:  Permits that expire in less than one year may be  
    issued where the building official determines a shorter period is  
    appropriate.  
  
      (2)  Renewal.  Permits may be renewed and renewed permits may be  
    further renewed by the building official provided the following  
    conditions are met:  
  
        a. Application for renewal shall be made within the thirty-day  
    period immediately preceding the date of expiration of the permit;  
  
        b. The work authorized by the permit has been started and is  
    progressing at a rate approved by the building official;  
  
        c. If an application for renewal is made either more than one year  
    after the effective date of a new or revised edition of the Electrical  
    Code, the permit shall not be renewed unless:  
  
        i. The building official determines that the permit complies, or  
    is modified to comply, with the code or codes in effect on the date of  
    application for renewal; or  
  
        ii. The work authorized by the permit is substantially underway  
    and progressing at a rate approved by the building official.  
  
      Permits may also be renewed where commencement or completion of the  
    work authorized by the permit was delayed by litigation, appeals,  
    strikes or other causes related to the work authorized by the permit,  
    beyond the permit holder's control.  
  
      (3) Re-establishment.  A new permit shall be required to complete  
    work where a permit has expired and was not renewed.  
  
    Exception:   A permit which has been expired for less than one year  
    may be reestablished upon approval of the building official provided  
    it complies with Items B and C of Section 303(d)2, above.  
  
    (E) Suspension or Revocation.  The building official may, by written  
    order, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this  
    code whenever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of  
    incorrect information, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation  
    or any provision of this code.  
  
    (F) Permit for Temporary Installations.  The building official may  
    issue permits for temporary electrical installations for use during  
    the construction of buildings or for carnivals, conventions,  
    festivals, fairs, the holding of religious services, temporary  
    lighting of streets and the like if it is found that life or property  
    will not be jeopardized.  
  
      Permission to use a temporary installation shall be granted for no  
    longer than six months, except that a permit for a temporary  
    installation to be used for the construction of a building may be  
    issued for the necessary period of construction.  Should temporary  
    lighting be over the street area, proper authority for use of the  
    street shall first be obtained from the Seattle Department of  
    Transportation.  All temporary installations shall comply with all  
    other requirements of this code.  
  
    Section 304 Permit Fees.  A fee for each electrical permit and for  
    other activities related to the enforcement of this code shall be paid  
    as set forth in the Fee Subtitle.  
  
    Section 305  INSPECTIONS  
  
    (A) General.  It shall be unlawful to connect or to allow the  
    connection of any electrical installations, extensions thereof, or  
    electrical equipment to the electric current until the work is  
    inspected and approved by the building official.  
  
    (B) Inspection Requests.  It shall be the duty of the owner of the  
    property, the owner's authorized agent, or the person designated by  
    the owner/agent to do the work authorized by a permit to notify the  
    building official that work as specified in this section is ready for  
    inspection. Where a permit has been issued to a licensed contractor,  
    it shall be the duty of the contractor to notify the building official  
    that work requiring inspection is ready for inspection.  
  
      It shall be the duty of the person requesting any inspections  
    required by this code to provide access to and means for proper  
    inspection of the work.  It shall be the duty of the permit holder to  
    cause the work to be accessible and exposed for inspection purposes.  
    Neither the building official nor the City shall be liable for expense  
    entailed in the required removal or replacement of any material to  
    allow inspection.  
  
    (C) Inspection Record.  Work requiring a permit shall not be commenced  
    until the permit holder or agent has posted an inspection record in a  
    conspicuous place on the premises and in a position which allows the  
    building official to conveniently make the required entries thereon  
    regarding inspection of the work.  This record shall be maintained in  
    such position by the permit holder until final approval has been  
    granted by the building official and the serving utility has made the  
    connection to the electric current.  
  
    (D) Approvals Required.  No work shall be done on any part of the  
    building or structure beyond the point indicated in each successive  
    inspection without first obtaining the written approval of the  
    building official.  Written approval shall be given only after an  
    inspection has been made of each successive step in the construction  
    as indicated by each of the inspections required in Section 305(E)  
    below.  
  
    (E) Required Inspections.  
  
      (1) Cover Inspection.  The building official is authorized to  
    conduct cover inspections when all of the following work has been  
    completed:  
  
        a. All piping, ducts, plumbing and like installations of other  
    trades which are liable to interfere or run in close proximity to the  
    electrical installation are permanently in place and inspected, but  
    prior to any work to cover or conceal any installation of electrical  
    equipment, and;  
  
        b. Electrical Equipment grounding (boxes, equipment, conductors  
    and provisions for grounding receptacles, etc.) for all systems shall  
    be completely made-up.  
  
        c. For conduit systems, after all conduit has been installed and  
    properly secured to the structure.  
  
      (2) Final Inspection.  The building official is authorized to  
    conduct a final inspection after all wiring has been completed and all  
    permanent fixtures such as switches, outlet receptacles, plates,  
    electric hot water tanks, lighting fixtures and all other equipment  
    has been properly installed.  The permit holder shall call for a final  
    inspection when the work described on the permit has been completed.  
  
    (F) Other Inspections.  In addition to the called inspections  
    specified in Subsection (E), the building official is authorized to  
    conduct or require any other inspections of any construction work to  
    ascertain compliance with the provisions of this code and other laws  
    enforced by the building official.  
  
      Where work, for which any permit or approval is required, is  
    commenced or performed prior to making formal application and  
    receiving the building official's permission to proceed, the building  
    official may make a special investigation inspection before a permit  
    may be issued for the work.  Where a special investigation is made, a  
    special investigation fee may be assessed in accordance with the Fee  
    Subtitle.  
  
    (G) Reinspections.  The building official is authorized to conduct a  
    reinspection when work is not complete, corrections not made, the  
    approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure  
    to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or  
    when deviations from plans that require the approval of the building  
    official have been made without proper approval.  
  
      For the purpose of determining compliance with Section 104(C)  
    Maintenance, the building official or the fire chief may cause any  
    structure to be reinspected.  
  
      The building official may assess a reinspection fee as set forth in  
    the Fee Subtitle for any action listed above for which reinspection  
    may be required, whether or not a reinspection is actually performed.  
    A reinspection fee shall not be assessed the first time the work  
    subject to inspection is rejected for failure to comply with the  
    requirements of this code.  
  
      In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no  
    additional inspection of the work shall be performed until the  
    required fees have been paid.

    performance test and subsequent evaluation shall be performed by a  
    firm having qualified personnel and proper equipment.  The tested  
    equipment shall be labeled identifying the firm, date of test, and  
    setting.  
  
      FPN No. 1: Ground-fault protection that functions to open the  
    service disconnect affords no protection from faults on the line side  
    of the protective element. It serves only to limit damage to  
    conductors and equipment on the load side in the event of an arcing  
    ground fault on the load side of the protective element.  
  
      FPN No. 2: This added protective equipment at the service equipment  
    may make it necessary to review the overall wiring system for proper  
    selective overcurrent protection coordination. Additional  
    installations of ground-fault protective equipment may be needed on  
    feeders and branch circuits where maximum continuity of electrical  
    service is necessary.  
  
      FPN No. 3: Where ground-fault protection is provided for the service  
    disconnect and interconnection is made with another supply system by a  
    transfer device, means or devices may be needed to ensure proper  
    ground-fault sensing by the ground-fault protection equipment.

    EXHIBIT A  
  
    Summary and Comparison of 2003 Seattle Electrical Code provisions in  
    relation to  
  
    the 2003 Washington State Electrical Code,  
  
    Chapter 296-46B Washington Administrative Code (WAC)  
  
    Prepared by the Department of Planning and Development,  
  
    Code Development and Electrical Review Section staff  
  
    Legislation Reviewed and Approved by the Seattle Electrical Code  
    Review Committee,  
  
    a duly appointed committee of the City of Seattle's Construction  
    Codes Advisory Board, and the Construction Codes Advisory Board  
  
    Authority  
  
    Chapter 19.28, Revised Code of Washington (RCW) grants local  
    jurisdictions the authority to adopt regulations applicable to  
    electrical installations that differ from regulations adopted by the  
    state, provided that the local regulations meet a minimum standard.  
    The authority to adopt local regulations and the standard by which  
    those regulations are judged is set forth at RCW 19.28.010 (3), which  
    states:  
  
    This chapter (RCW 19.28) shall not limit the authority or power of  
    any city or town to enact and enforce under authority given by law,  
    any ordinance, rule, or regulation requiring an equal, higher, or  
    better standard of construction and an equal, higher, or better  
    standard of materials, devices, appliances, and equipment than that  
    required by this chapter.  
  
    Purpose  
  
    The purpose of this document is twofold:  The primary purpose is to  
    set forth the City of Seattle's analysis and determination that the  
    differences between the 2003 Seattle Electrical Code (SEC) and the  
    2003 Washington State Electrical Code, meet the standard of RCW  
    19.28.010 (3) for local amendments.  The secondary purpose of this  
    document is to identify sections containing new amendments and  
    clarifying language not found in the 1999 SEC, noted below as "*NEW*"  
    in the "2003 SEC" column.

    Analysis  
  
    WAC 296-46B-010 (1)-(13), (15), (16), (19), (20), (23), (24)  
  
    102.2  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Chapter 296-46B Washington Administrative Code. Certain WAC sections  
    are not adopted for the following reasons:  
  
    296-46B-010 (1): Seattle Municipal Code section 22.300.016, as  
    proposed by the Seattle Electrical Code ordinance, adopts the 2002  
    NEC as the base code.  The other standards referenced in this WAC  
    section are not affected by the Seattle Electrical Code as they do  
    not amend the 2002 NEC.  
  
    296-46B-010 (2): This is an administrative standard not related to a  
    specific NEC requirement.  SEC provides an equivalent standard at  
    Section 202(G).  
  
    296-46B-010 (3): This is an administrative standard not related to a  
    specific NEC requirement.  The City of Seattle enforces the WACs  
    rules and SEC.  
  
    296-46B-010 (4): This is an administrative standard not related to a  
    specific NEC requirement.  SEC Section provides an equivalent  
    standard for variances.  
  
    296-46B-010 (5)-(10): These are administrative standards not related  
    to specific NEC requirements.  SEC Section 305 provides equivalent  
    standards relating to inspections and elsewhere in the code as  
    appropriate.  
  
    296-46B-010 (11)-(13): These are administrative standards not related  
    to specific NEC requirements.  SEC Section 104(E) provides an  
    equivalent or better standard for moved buildings.  
  
    296-46B-010 (15)-(16): These are administrative standards not related  
    to specific NEC requirements.  SEC Section 302(B) requires plan  
    review meeting the requirements of the WACs for educational,  
    institutional or health care facilities and other buildings.  
  
    296-46B-010 (19)-(20): These are administrative standards not related  
    to specific NEC requirements.  Requirements for plan review are set  
    forth in Section 302(B).  
  
    296-46B-010 (23): This is an administrative standard not related to  
    specific NEC requirements.  The Seattle Fire Code requires that plans  
    be submitted for review and approval of fire alarm systems.  
  
    296-46B-010 (24): This is an administrative standard not related to  
    specific NEC requirements.  SEC plan review and permitting  
    requirements are set forth at Section 302 and 303.  
  
    104(A)  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Additions, Alterations and Repairs. Amendment to this section  
    requires installation of receptacles in additions, alterations and  
    repairs to existing buildings per the requirements set forth at  
    Section 406.3(D) regulating replacement of receptacles.  
  
    WAC 296-46B-030  
  
    106  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Utilization Equipment and Alternate Materials and Methods of Wiring.  
    This is an administrative standard not related to specific NEC  
    requirements.  The provisions for utilization equipment in WAC 296-  
    46B-030 are superseded by SEC Section 106, which provides an  
    equivalent standard.  Section 106 requires applicants to demonstrate  
    that the proposed utilization equipment or alternate means and  
    methods of wiring provide an equivalent level of strength,  
    effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, safety and sanitation as  
    set forth in the SEC for similar installations.  This language is  
    similar to sections in the Building and Mechanical codes and gives  
    DCLU clearer authority to approve variations from strict compliance  
    with the code when staff believe all the features of the building  
    make it as safe as if there had been literal compliance with the  
    code.  
  
    NEC 90.1, 90.2 and 90.4  
  
    102.1, 103, and 106  
  
    SEC provides equivalent purpose, scope, and  
    enforcement/interpretation sections specific to administration of the  
    Electrical Code in Seattle.  
  
    204(B)  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Notice of Violation. Added section that mimics authority granted in  
    other building-related codes.  Omission of this section from previous  
    versions of the SEC appears to be an oversight.  
  
    209  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Review by the Director. Added section to enhance due process/review  
    of notices of violation an other levied penalties.  This section is  
    similar to a section found in the Building Code.  
  
    301(B)(4)  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Exempted Work. Amendment clarifies that wiring for communication  
    systems in single family residences and other installations of 1000  
    feet or less do not need to apply for a permit.  
  
    302(B)  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Plans and Specifications. Amendment clarifies that any proposed  
    installation covering more than 2,500 square feet or that cannot be  
    adequately described on a permit application require plan review.  
    Other amendments coordinate plan review requirements for certain  
    occupancies with State regulations.  
  
    NEC Art. 100  
  
    Art. 100  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Definitions. SEC provides equivalent standard.  Added language aligns  
    meaning of terms not defined in the NEC or SEC with terms defined in  
    the Seattle Building and Mechanical Codes and Webster's Dictionary.  
  
    NEC Art. 100, Part I  
  
    Art. 100,  
  
    Part I  
  
    Cross reference added to code section that provides requirements for  
    service point connections.  
  
    NEC Art. 100, Part I  
  
    Art. 100,  
  
    Part I  
  
    Added definition of "service terminal box," a term of art used in  
    Seattle but not defined in the NEC or WAC.  
  
    NEC 110.13  
  
    110.13  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Mounting, Cooling and Location of Equipment. SEC amendment adds  
    clarity to this section by aligning it with the Seattle Building Code  
    and local utility requirements.  
  
    NEC 110.22  
  
    110.22  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Identification of Disconnecting Means. SEC amendment adds clarity to  
    this section by aligning it with the WAC requirements.  
  
    110.24  
  
    Electrified fences. SEC adds section enhancing public safety by  
    permitting electric fences only by special permission.  
  
    NEC 110.26  
  
    110.26  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    110.26 Spaces about Electrical Equipment. SEC provides better  
    standard by requiring illumination of residential panelboards  
    installed outdoors and prohibits panelboards in crawlspaces or  
    similar potentially difficult or dangerous locations.  
  
    NEC 210.8  
  
    210.8  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Ground-Fault Circuit-Interrupter Protection for Personnel. SEC  
    provides better standard by requiring installation of GFCI outlets  
    serving countertops near all sinks.  SEC amendment mirrors  
    requirements for residential construction and requires GFCI  
    protection of all outlets located outside or in crawlspaces at or  
    below grade where risk of electrical shock due to wet conditions may  
    be prevalent.  GFCI protection of outlets is widely accepted as the  
    most cost effective, safe and prudent method of protecting personnel  
    from shock hazards in potentially wet locations.  
  
    NEC 210.52  
  
    210.52  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Dwelling Unit Receptacle Outlets. Amendment aligns SEC with WAC that  
    allows receptacles in appliance garages to be counted as required  
    countertop receptacles.  
  
    WAC 296-46B-215 010  
  
    230.95(C)  
  
    SEC provides an equivalent standard by incorporating the performance  
    testing requirements of WAC 296-46B-215 010 into SEC Section  
    230.95(C).  NEC 215.10 refers the user to Section 230.95 for GFPE  
    requirements; thus, it was determined that SEC 230.95 is the more  
    appropriate location for the testing requirement.  
  
    215.12  
  
    Panelboards. Added section provides better standard than NEC by  
    limiting the number of power sources supplying one multifamily  
    dwelling unit for occupant protection.

    WAC 296-46B-334 010  
  
    334.10  
  
    *NEW*  
  
    Uses Permitted. SEC provides equivalent standard as WAC.  The  
    committee recommended adopting and modifying the national standard  
    for wiring Type III, IV, and V buildings, which allows use of NM  
    cable.  The SEC provides a better standard than the NEC by  
    restricting use of NM cable to concealed locations providing a  
    thermal barrier of at least a 15-minute finish rating as identified  
    in listing of fire rated assemblies.  In Seattle, the effect of this  
    section would be to allow use of NM cable in up to 5 stories of a  
    wood-framed structure above grade rather than 3 stories above grade  
    as provided by the WAC.  Reasons considered by the committee in  
    making their recommendation include, but are not limited to, the  
    following:  
  
    * This provision would be used most frequently in multifamily  
    buildings that the Seattle Building Code typically requires to be  
    protected throughout by sprinkler systems, fire alarm systems, and  
    stairway pressurization systems, in addition to other robust fire  
    resistive construction requirements for means of egress components.  
    The aggregate of these Seattle Building Code requirements improves  
    the overall fire and life safety conditions of these structures that  
    would not be diminished by allowing use of NM cable through two  
    additional stories of wood frame construction.  
  
    * There are many UL-listed through-penetration firestop systems for  
    NM cable that have been tested and certified to meet fire-resistive  
    rating requirements for wood-frame assemblies of Type III, IV, and V  
    buildings.  
  
    * There is not an appreciable difference in risk between 3-story and  
    5-story wood frame buildings.  A 3-story wood frame building is less  
    likely to be protected throughout by sprinkler, fire alarm, and  
    pressurization systems.  
  
    * In wood-frame structures, MC cable may be subject to more damage  
    due to its inflexibility.  NM cable was specifically developed as a  
    substitute for MC cable due to persistent problems of breakage and  
    subsequent cutting or shorting of conductors within MC cable used in  
    wood-frame assemblies.  
  
    * The requirement that NM cable be concealed behind at least a 15-  
    minute thermal barrier provides an equivalent amount of protection to  
    the conductors as does MC cable.  
  
    * If MC cable is accidentally punctured by a nail, an arc-fault can  
    be created to the sheath, whereas this hazard is minimized by use of  
    NM cable.  
  
    * Amendment to Section 300.4 requires two-piece interlocking  
    grommets, which provides NM cable additional protection from physical  
    damage if used in metal frame assemblies.  
  
    * This issue has been debated on a national level for several years  
    and two international model code bodies, the National Fire Protection  
    Association and the International Code Council have decided in favor  
    of allowing the expanded use of NM cable.  In addition, this issue  
    has been debated and settled for the 2005 edition of the NEC with no  
    change from the current edition.  
  
    The City of Seattle supports the majority recommendation of the  
    Electrical Review Committee that the weight of evidence in support of  
    expanding the use of NM cable through two more stories of wood-frame  
    construction does not represent a diminishment of the fire and life  
    safety requirements pertaining to these structures.  
  
    NEC 334.15

    Exposed Work. SEC amendment clarifies installation requirements  
    pertaining to NM cable in concealed spaces that provide a higher

    concealed, which provides and additional level of protection.
