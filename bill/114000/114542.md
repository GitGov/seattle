    AN ORDINANCE relating to disposition of City real property in the Pike  
    Place Urban Renewal Project area; authorizing an agreement with the  
    Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority for the  
    transfer to the Authority of a parcel of land at 1416 Western Avenue  
    for development of low-income housing and a senior services center;  
    authorizing delivery of a deed and other actions to implement the  
    agreement; and ratifying and confirming prior acts.  
  
    WHEREAS, the City is the owner of certain land in the Pike Place Urban  
    Renewal Project area, at 1416 Western Ave., which has been used for  
    surface parking, sometimes referred to as the "Creamery" lot (the  
    "Property"); and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority  
    proposes to develop such land with a building to include extremely  
    low-income housing and a senior services center and such development  
    would further a public market purpose as defined in the Pike Place  
    Market Preservation and Development Authority Charter and would  
    further the purposes of the Pike Place Market Historical District  
    Ordinance; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Community Renewal Act, RCW 35.81.090, authorizes the  
    disposition of the Property for such consideration as the City deems  
    adequate, taking into account the uses permitted; the restrictions  
    upon, and the covenants, conditions, and obligations assumed by, the  
    transferee; and the public benefits to be realized, and RCW 35.81.130  
    authorizes a public body to transfer property to another public body  
    with or without consideration for purposes of carrying out of a  
    community renewal project; NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1.  The Mayor or his designee is authorized to enter into and  
    perform an agreement ("Agreement") with the Pike Place Market  
    Preservation and Development Authority ("Authority") for the transfer  
    of the Property, legally described as:  
  
    The southwesterly 88.3 feet of Lot 4, Block F, A.A. Denny's 4th  
    Addition to the City of Seattle, as recorded in Volume 1 of Plats,  
    page 69, Records of King County, Washington,  
  
    to the Authority, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth  
    in this ordinance, and only after the City Council shall have approved  
    by ordinance the form of the Agreement. Consideration for the transfer  
    of the Property shall be the fair market value of the Property based  
    upon an appraisal, subject to restrictions of record and to  
    development and use conditions that the City shall impose, which shall  
    include, but not be limited to, those described in Sections 3 and 6 of  
    this ordinance.  The Agreement shall provide for the consideration to  
    be provided in such forms and at such times as the Mayor or his  
    designee shall deem appropriate, and may include public benefits to be  
    provided by the Authority, valued in such manner as the Mayor or his  
    designee deems appropriate.  
  
    Section 2.  The Agreement shall require the Authority to use diligent  
    efforts to pursue design work, financing applications, environmental  
    reports, permit applications and all other steps necessary to  
    construct and permanently finance improvements on the Property as  
    described in Section 3 of this ordinance.  All such efforts of the  
    Authority shall be at its own expense and risk.  The Agreement shall  
    require that the Property be developed in conformity with the Pike  
    Place Market Historical District ordinance, SMC Chapter 25.24, the  
    Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority Charter (as  
    amended), and all other applicable ordinances.  The Agreement shall  
    provide interim deadlines as deemed appropriate by the Mayor or his  
    designee, which may be extended in the discretion of the Mayor or his  
    designee, but in any event the Agreement shall terminate if the  
    conditions to transfer of the Property by the City are not satisfied  
    within two (2) years of the effective date of this ordinance.  
  
    Section 3.  The improvements to be developed on the Property are to  
    include:  
  
    (a)  at least 18 units of housing for extremely low-income households,  
    with rents affordable to such households; and (b) at least 7,700  
    square feet for a senior services center.  The housing and senior  
    services center space, together with any additional improvements to be  
    developed on the Property with the approval of the Mayor or his  
    designee and all necessary regulatory approvals, are referred to in  
    this ordinance as the "Project".   For purposes of this section:  
  
    (i) an "extremely low-income household" is a household with annual  
    income, at the time of initial occupancy of a housing unit, at or  
    below 30% of the median family income for the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett  
    Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area, as published annually by the  
    United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and as  
    adjusted for the size of the household in such manner as the Mayor or  
    his designee shall determine, and  
  
    (ii) a unit is considered "affordable" to an extremely low-income  
    household if the annual rent paid by the household, together with a  
    reasonable allowance for utilities paid by the household, is no  
    greater than 35% of the maximum annual income for an extremely low-  
    income household, as adjusted, in such manner as the Mayor or his  
    designee shall determine, for the average size of household likely to  
    occupy the unit.  
  
    Section 4.  The City Council recognizes that the actual development  
    capacity of the Property will depend upon the results of applicable  
    regulatory processes and financial feasibility.  If the Mayor or his  
    designee shall determine that, because of regulatory, financial or  
    other constraints, the Authority will be unable to develop a project  
    on the Property that includes both the minimum number of units for  
    extremely low-income households and the minimum amount of senior  
    services center space set forth in Section 3 of this ordinance, then  
    the Mayor  shall recommend to the City Council either an amendment to  
    the Agreement reducing the scale of the Project or other alternative  
    plan for the Property, both of which shall require approval by  
    ordinance.  
  
    Section 5.  The Agreement shall provide for the transfer of the  
    Property to the Authority after the Mayor or his designee is satisfied  
    that (1) the Authority has obtained all necessary financing  
    commitments for the construction and permanent financing of the  
    Project as described in Section 3 of this ordinance; (2) necessary and  
    appropriate amendments have been made to the Pike Place Market  
    Preservation and Development Authority Charter to permit the financing  
    of the development of the Property as contemplated herein and receipt  
    of all necessary approvals required under any such amendment; and (3)  
    any other conditions in the Agreement, as may be deemed necessary or  
    appropriate by the Mayor or his designee, are satisfied.  The  
    Agreement shall require that all costs incidental to the closing and  
    conveyance of the Property be paid by the Authority.  
  
    Section 6.  The Mayor shall present the forms of Agreement, deed and  
    covenants (as described below in this section) to City Council for  
    approval by ordinance.  If such approval is granted, the Mayor or his  
    designee is authorized to execute, for delivery and recording upon  
    satisfaction of conditions as described in Section 5 of this  
    ordinance, and upon payment or delivery of such other consideration,  
    or security therefor, as the Agreement may require at closing pursuant  
    to Section 1 of this ordinance, a quitclaim deed to the Property,  
    subject to the terms of the Pike Place Urban Renewal Plan, the Pike  
    Place Market Preservation and Development Authority Charter (as  
    amended) and the Pike Place Market Historical District Ordinance, to  
    covenants as described below and to any other reservations or  
    conditions that shall be contained in the form of deed as approved by  
    ordinance.  The Agreement shall provide that, as a condition of the  
    transfer and simultaneously with the delivery and recordation of the  
    deed, the Authority shall execute, deliver and record against the  
    title to the Property, covenants acceptable to the Mayor or his  
    designee committing to the maintenance of 18 units of extremely low-  
    income housing for at least 40 years and a senior services center of  
    at least 7,700 square feet for at least 15 years.  
  
    Section 7.  The Agreement shall require that the Project be completed  
    by a date no later than June 1, 2006.   The Agreement shall have such  
    other terms and conditions, consistent with applicable laws and the  
    intent of this ordinance, as the Mayor or his designee shall deem  
    appropriate.  
  
    Section 8.  The Agreement shall not be assignable by the Authority.  
    The Agreement, and the covenants to be recorded at closing of the  
    transfer, shall prohibit any sale or other transfer of the Property  
    prior to completion of the Project without the express written consent  
    of the City, except for mortgages, deeds of trust, regulatory  
    agreements and covenants for the purposes of the financing  
    contemplated by the Agreement.  The Agreement and such covenants shall  
    not prohibit any transfer upon foreclosure of a deed of trust or  
    mortgage approved by the Mayor or his designee, or in lieu of  
    foreclosure thereof, or any subsequent transfer, but any transfer  
    shall be subject to the requirements as to use of the Property set  
    forth in the covenants.  The Mayor or his designee may approve a  
    transfer of the Property to a limited partnership or limited liability  
    company managed by the Authority, if (a) the Mayor or his designee  
    finds such transfer is necessary for the financing of the Project; (b)  
    upon such transfer, the senior services center is subject to a lease  
    or operating agreement with a term of at least fifteen years, under  
    which the lessee or operator is the Authority or a nonprofit  
    organization approved by the Mayor or his designee, in either case on  
    terms and conditions acceptable to the Mayor or his designee;  and (c)  
    the terms of any agreements related to the transfer provide assurance  
    deemed adequate by the Mayor or his designee that the Authority, or a  
    successor entity approved by the City, will have the right to  
    reacquire title to the Property by 2020 on terms that will not require  
    significant public funds, and that in the event the Authority should  
    cease to be the manager of such partnership or company, any successor  
    manager would be a nonprofit or public entity approved by the City.  
    Any other voluntary transfer by the Authority prior to completion of  
    the Project shall require the approval of the City Council by  
    ordinance.  
  
    Section 9.   The Mayor and his designees are authorized to execute and  
    deliver such additional documents, which may include amendments to the  
    Agreement and related covenants, and to take such other actions, as  
    may be necessary or appropriate to implement the intent of this  
    ordinance, and to administer and enforce the Agreement, covenants, and  
    any other such documents.  
  
    Section 10.  Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the  
    effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.  
  
    Section 11.  This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty  
    (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not  
    approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after  
    presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code  
    Section 1.04.020.
