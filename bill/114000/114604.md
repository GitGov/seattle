    NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
      Section 1.  The Mayor or the Director of the Office of Economic  
    Development ("OED Director") is authorized, on behalf of The City of  
    Seattle, to lend and cause the disbursement of up to One Million Three  
    Hundred Thousand  Dollars ($1,300,000) from the proceeds of the City's  
    $15,500,000 note ("Note") with HUD, attached as Exhibit A, to The  
    Compass Center, a Lutheran Organization, (the "Compass Center") a  
    Washington nonprofit corporation, pursuant to the Loan Agreement  
    authorized in Section 2 of this Ordinance, to finance the acquisition  
    of 210 Alaskan Way South in the Pioneer Square neighborhood.  The  
    Mayor or the OED Director is further authorized, on behalf of The City  
    of Seattle, to cause there to be drawn from the federal treasury and  
    deposited in the Special Purpose Grants Fund, No. 17820, companion  
    Brownfields Economic Development Initiative ("BEDI") Grant funds in  
    the amount of One Hundred Forty-six Thousand Seven Hundred Seventy-  
    four Dollars ($146,774), and pursuant to the appropriation in Section  
    4 of this ordinance, to cause the disbursement of such amount for the  
    benefit of the Compass Center, for the purposes of reducing or  
    subsidizing interest obligations on the Section 108 loan.  The amount  
    of such BEDI Grant funds is based on the ratio of the maximum amount  
    of the Section 108 loan ($1,300,000) to the total Note proceeds (i.e.,  
    $15,500,000).  
  
      Section 2.  The Mayor or the OED Director is authorized, on behalf  
    of The City of Seattle, to execute, deliver, administer and cause to  
    be performed a Loan Agreement with the Compass Center based on the  
    form attached as Exhibit B, with such additions, modifications, and  
    amendments as HUD may require or the Mayor or OED Director may deem  
    necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance,  
    together with such ancillary and related documents as the Mayor or OED  
    Director may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of  
    this Ordinance.  Such modifications may include, without limitation,  
    provision for an interest rate payable by the Compass Center that may  
    be at a rate higher than or different from that interest rate payable  
    on the Note, provisions establishing, adjusting or eliminating a  
    periodic monitoring fee or a similar fee payable by the Compass  
    Center, or both.  The loan to the Compass Center shall be secured by  
    an irrevocable letter of credit from the date of loan closing through  
    the period of construction at 210 Alaskan Way South.  The letter of  
    credit shall have an initial stated amount of One Million Three  
    Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,300,000); provided, that such stated  
    amount will be reduced to $970,000 upon receipt by The Compass Center  
    of the proceeds of CDBG funds from The City of Seattle and also upon  
    principal payments on the loan from time to time, if any, all in  
    accordance with the reimbursement agreement between the commercial  
    bank issuing the letter of credit and The Compass Center.  The letter  
    of credit shall be issued by a commercial bank satisfactory to the OED  
    Director, shall be in a form and content satisfactory to the OED  
    Director, shall have an expiration date (the "Expiration Date") that  
    is twenty-four (24) months after the date of its issuance, which  
    Expiration Date may be extended for a period of six (6) months, and  
    shall permit The City of Seattle to make a draw for the full amount  
    available thereunder unless construction at 210 Alaskan Way South  
    shall have been completed ( with such completion date evidenced by a  
    certificate of occupancy, acceptable to the OED Director in her sole  
    discretion) prior to the Expiration Date.  The loan to the Compass  
    Center shall also be secured by a first lien position deed of trust,  
    in form and content acceptable to the OED Director, against the  
    property being acquired with such loan, which deed of trust may also  
    run equally to the benefit of the commercial bank issuing the letter  
    of credit for so long as any reimbursement obligations of the Compass  
    Center remain outstanding with respect thereto.  Moreover, the Loan  
    Agreement shall provide, consistent with HUD regulations, that the  
    Compass Center shall take affirmative steps to assure that minority  
    and women's business enterprises are used when possible, that the  
    Compass Center  shall maintain records of those steps, and that  
    nothing in the Loan Agreement shall be construed to require or  
    authorize any discrimination or preferential treatment contrary to  
    applicable law.  
  
      Section 3.  The specific terms of the loan to the Compass Center,  
    and the use of the BEDI Grant, shall be based on the terms outlined in  
    Exhibit C, with such adjustments as HUD may require, or the Mayor or  
    OED Director deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of  
    this Ordinance.  
  
      Section 4.  To the extent that BEDI Grant funds (in addition to BEDI  
    Grant funds previously received and disbursed under Ordinance 120873),  
    are received by the City in the Special Purpose Grants Fund, the  
    appropriation for the following in the 2003 Budget is increased from  
    the fund shown, as follows:

    Fund, No.  
    17820  
  
      Section 5.  The Mayor or OED Director is further authorized to  
    negotiate and execute such additional agreements as the Mayor or OED  
    Director deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of this  
    Ordinance and to implement the Section 108 loan guaranty.  The  
    agreement(s) with the Custodian and the additional agreements  
    authorized by this Section 5 shall be in the form and contain such  
    terms and conditions as the Mayor or OED Director may deem necessary  
    or advisable to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance.  
  
      Section 6.  The Mayor or OED Director may require the Compass Center  
    to pay a loan origination fee of no more than one percent (1%) of the  
    loan amount, i.e., no more than the cumulative amount of Thirteen  
    Thousand Dollars ($13,000).  Such fee shall be paid directly to the  
    Custodian to be held in trust for the purposes set forth in this  
    Section 6.  The OED Director is authorized to cause all or a portion  
    of this fee to be disbursed to the National Development Council for  
    consulting services related to the loan authorized hereby, in  
    accordance with the City's existing contract with the National  
    Development Council, and to pay for the City's legal fees and any  
    other costs related to the issuance and placement of the Note and the  
    administration of the transactions authorized by this Ordinance, that  
    are not paid by the Compass Center pursuant to the Loan Agreement.  
    The OED Director is authorized to cause (i) any remaining portion of  
    such fee and (ii) any payments received representing any difference  
    between the interest rates charged to the Compass Center and the lower  
    rates applicable to the Note or representing a periodic monitoring fee  
    or similar fee, to be applied to payment of expenses incurred in the  
    administration of any federally guaranteed or federally funded  
    economic development loan or program administered by the OED Director  
    or to be remitted to the City and deposited in the Housing and  
    Community Development Revenue Sharing Fund.  
  
      Section 7.  The Director of the Human Services Department ("HSD  
    Director") is authorized to (a) amend the City's 2001-2004  
    Consolidated Plan, including the 2003 Action Plan, to reflect the  
    transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and (b) provide OED with  
    technical assistance to ensure compliance with Community Development  
    Block Grant ("CDBG") regulations applicable to the Section 108 loan  
    program.  The Mayor, OED Director, and the HSD Director are authorized  
    to take such other actions as they shall deem necessary to implement  
    the actions authorized by this Ordinance.  
  
      Section 8.  This Ordinance is not intended to create, and shall not  
    be construed to create, any contractual or otherwise binding  
    obligation upon, or commitment by, the City for the benefit of the  
    Compass Center or any other party interested in the acquisition or  
    rehabilitation project of the Compass Center.  The commitments to the  
    Compass Center authorized by this Ordinance, subject to the  
    limitations herein and under applicable law, shall become effective  
    only if and when the agreements authorized hereby are duly executed  
    and delivered by the City and other necessary parties.  
  
      Section 9.  Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the  
    effective date of this Ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.

    (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not

      This Agreement is entered into upon the basis of the following facts  
    and circumstances:  
  
      A.  Obligor will purchase the real property described in Attachment

    below).  Obligor intends to construct new improvements on the Property  
    and rehabilitate certain adjacent property as described in Attachment  
    B, attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference (the  
    "Project").  
  
      B.  City has applied for and received a commitment from the United

    guarantee a non-recourse note or notes (as supplemented or amended  
    from time to time, and together with any replacements thereof issued  
    by the City and guaranteed by HUD pursuant to the HUD Contract  
    described below, the "City Note") to be issued by City to fund the  
    Loan, in accordance with Section 108 of the Housing and Community  
    Development Act of 1974, as amended (such Act and the federal  
    regulations promulgated thereunder are hereinafter collectively called  
    the "Act").  The City Note is the subject of a Contract for Loan  
    Guarantee Assistance between the City and HUD (as supplemented or  
    amended from time to time, the "HUD Contract") and certain Letter  
    Agreements for Section 108 Guarantee Program Custodial Account (as

    Account as "Custodian").  City has also entered into an Indenture of

    Letter Agreements.  The HUD Contract is entered into pursuant to an  
    application submitted to HUD by the City dated June 18, 2002, a copy  
    of which Obligor has received and reviewed (as supplemented or amended  
    from time to time, the "Application").  The Application, HUD Contract,

    this reference.  Unless the context otherwise provides, capitalized  
    terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings  
    assigned to them in the HUD Contract or City Note, as applicable.  
  
      C.  The Office of Economic Development of the City ("OED") is  
    responsible within The City of Seattle for making, subject to City  
    Council approval, loans of funds obtained from HUD by pledges of  
    Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") funds to be made available  
    to the City by HUD, pursuant to the Act.  Unless the City otherwise  
    notifies Obligor, in writing, the OED shall be responsible for  
    performance of the obligations of the City under this Agreement and  
    the other Loan Documents, and for oversight of performance of such  
    agreements by Obligor, and references hereinafter made to the City  
    shall be deemed to mean the City, acting through OED.  
  
      D.  The Loan shall be evidenced by this Agreement and by Obligor's  
    Promissory Note ("Obligor Note") in the form attached hereto as  
    Attachment C and hereby incorporated by reference, and together with  
    Obligor's other obligations under the Loan Documents, secured by a  
    Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Security Agreement  
    with Fixture Filing in the form and content acceptable to the City (as  
    supplemented or amended from time to time, and together with any other  
    assignments of leases, tenant estoppels, subordination and attornment  
    agreements delivered in accordance with this Agreement, the "Deed of  
    Trust") on the Property, dated on or about the date hereof.  The  
    Obligor Note, this Agreement, the Deed of Trust, and any other  
    documents or instruments executed by Obligor in favor of City pursuant  
    hereto with the sole exception of the Certificate and Indemnity  
    (defined in Section 3.1 of this Agreement), are collectively referred  
    to herein as the "Loan Documents".  Where the context so requires, to  
    the extent that the Loan Documents provide that Obligor's obligations  
    or duties thereunder are determined by reference to any terms or  
    provisions of documents incorporated by reference in any of the Loan  
    Documents, any reference to the "Loan Documents" shall include such  
    terms or provisions.  
  
      E.  The Obligor's obligations under this Agreement, the other Loan  
    Documents and the Certificate and Indemnity shall be further secured  
    by the assignment of certain additional collateral as required by HUD.  
  
      F.  Prior to the date when ___________________________________  
    ("Project Completion Date"), payment of the principal of the Obligor  
    Note will be guaranteed by a letter of credit (the "Letter of Credit")  
    to be issued by KeyBank National Association (the "Bank"), pursuant to  
    a Reimbursement Agreement of even date herewith, and related documents  
    (collectively, the "Reimbursement Documents") between the Bank and the  
    Obligor.  
  
      G.  In order to stabilize, to the extent feasible, Obligor's  
    interest obligation with respect to the Loan at a rate equal to four  
    percent (4.0%) per annum, the City will transfer funds in the maximum  
    aggregate amount of One Hundred Forty-Six Thousand Seven Hundred  
    Seventy-Four and no/100 Dollars ($146,774), derived solely from a BEDI  
    Grant made by HUD for such purposes, to the Custodian, for deposit  
    into a reserve account (the "BEDI Grant Reserve Account") to be  
    established at Closing and held so long as the Loan remains  
    outstanding as a pledged account securing repayment of the Loan and  
    City Note, subject to application as an interest subsidy on the Loan  
    from time to time.  
  
    NOTICE:  ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY, EXTEND  
    CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT, ARE NOT  
    ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.  
  
      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and the  
    covenants, conditions, representations and warranties contained  
    herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:  
  
    ARTICLE I - THE LOAN  
  
       
  
      1.1  The Loan  .  In reliance upon Obligor's representations  
    and warranties, and subject to the terms and conditions contained in  
    this Agreement, the other Loan Documents (including without  
    limitation, the HUD Contract, the Letter Agreements and the Custodial  
    Agreement), and the Certificate and Indemnity (hereinafter defined),  
    the City hereby agrees to cause funds to be advanced to Obligor  
    through the Custodian (which advances collectively shall constitute  
    the "Loan") in a maximum aggregate principal amount equal to One  
    Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,300,000), solely for the  
    purposes set forth in Section 1.2 below.  Loan disbursements shall be  
    made only to the extent of available funds received by the Custodian  
    for such purposes through issuance by the City of the City Note, and  
    except with respect to the payment of interest from BEDI Grant funds  
    allocated for such purpose as more particularly described in Section  
    4.6(b) of this Agreement and the Custodial Agreement, the City shall  
    have no obligation to make disbursements to or for the benefit of  
    Obligor for acquisition of the Property, payment of costs of the  
    Project or otherwise, from any other source.  Obligor shall have the  
    right to receive Loan funds only pursuant to the terms and conditions  
    of this Agreement and in accordance with the Act.  
  
      1.2  Purpose of Loan  .  Loan proceeds shall be used by  
    Obligor solely for the costs of acquiring the Property and related  
    financing costs in accordance with this Agreement.  
  
      1.3  Loan Documentation; Interest  .  
  
    (a)  Loan Documentation.  The Loan shall be evidenced by this  
    Agreement and by the Obligor Note, and together with Obligor's other  
    obligations under the Loan Documents (but not the Certificate and  
    Indemnity), shall be secured by the Deed of Trust.  The principal of  
    and interest on this Loan shall be due and payable in accordance with  
    the terms set forth in the Obligor Note.  
  
        (b)  Interest.  Obligor acknowledges and agrees that, as  
    provided in the Obligor Note, interest shall accrue on each advance of  
    Loan funds from the date of the correlative Advance under the City  
    Note until repayment in full, at a rate or rates equal to the  
    correlative interest rate or rates on the City Note, as the same may  
    change from time to time under the terms of the City Note and HUD  
    Contract. Initially and continuing to the Conversion Date, such  
    interest shall accrue at a rate equal to twenty (20) basis points  
    (.20%) over the Applicable LIBO Rate, subject to adjustment as set  
    forth in the City Note.  From and after the Conversion Date (whether  
    conversion to a fixed rate or rates is effected with the consent of  
    Obligor or otherwise), each principal amount scheduled to become due  
    on a particular date pursuant to the City Note shall bear interest at  
    a separate, stated rate, and the principal amount scheduled to become  
    due in the same year on the Obligor Note shall bear interest at the  
    same rate. Any principal of the Loan or interest thereon which is  
    unpaid after the date when payment is due shall bear interest at the  
    rate stated for amounts past due in the Obligor Note.  
  
        (c)   Consent to Conversion.  Obligor acknowledges and  
    agrees that so long as no default shall have occurred under the  
    respective Loan Agreements and the other loan documents between the  
    City and 211 First Avenue Building L.P., Buttnick Building, L.P. and  
    Triad City Loan LLC (collectively, the "Prior Obligors") which has not  
    been cured or waived in accordance with the terms thereof, the City  
    has agreed not to request or consent to conversion of the interest  
    rate on the City Note to a fixed rate or rates, without the prior  
    written consent of the Prior Obligors. In addition, Obligor  
    acknowledges and agrees that under the HUD Contract, HUD will have the  
    unilateral right (with or without notice to or consent of the City,  
    the Prior Obligors and/or Obligor) to require that the City Note be  
    included in a Public Offering, which will result in fixing the  
    interest rate payable on each maturity of the City Note and on the  
    Obligor Note.  
  
      1.4  Security  .  
  
        (a)  Deed of Trust.  The obligations of Obligor under the  
    Loan Documents (but not the Certificate and Indemnity) at all times  
    shall be secured by the Deed of Trust, which shall be a first lien on  
    the Property and security interest in all personal property associated  
    with the Property, subject only to the parity interest of the Bank and  
    to other encumbrances permitted in accordance with Section 2.4 below.  
    The liens and security interests granted pursuant to the Deed of Trust  
    shall be perfected, to the extent possible, by recording in the real  
    property records of King County, Washington, and by filing with the  
    Department of Licensing of the State of Washington, and Obligor agrees  
    to take all action reasonably requested by the City or Custodian, and  
    to pay all fees and costs reasonably required to continue such  
    perfection so long as the Loan or any of Obligor's other obligations  
    under the Loan Documents remain outstanding.  The Deed of Trust shall  
    include an assignment of leases and rents; however, upon request by  
    the City, the Obligor agrees to obtain execute and deliver such  
    additional assignments of leases, and consents to assignment and  
    subordination and attornment agreements from individual tenants of the  
    Property as the City may reasonably request prior or subsequent to  
    Closing (defined in Section 4.1 of this Agreement).  Obligor  
    understands and agrees that City may assign the Deed of Trust to HUD  
    as security for HUD's rights in connection with its guarantee of the  
    City Note.  
  
        (b)  Letter of Credit.  From the date of Loan closing until  
    the Project Completion Date, principal of the Obligor Note shall be  
    guaranteed by a Letter of Credit issued by the Bank, in form and  
    substance acceptable to the City.  The Letter of Credit shall have an  
    initial stated amount of One Million Three Hundred Thousand and no/100  
    Dollars ($1,300,000); provided, that such stated amount will be  
    reduced to $970,000 upon receipt by Obligor of the proceeds of CDBG  
    funds from the City and also upon principal payments on the Loan from  
    time to time, if any, all in accordance with the Reimbursement  
    Agreement.  The Letter of Credit will expire by its terms on the  
    earlier of the date which is twenty-four (24) months after the date of  
    closing or the date upon which a Certificate of Occupancy for the new  
    building on the Property, permitting its use for the purposes intended  
    upon Project completion, is issued, subject to a six-month extension  
    in accordance with the Reimbursement Agreement.  
  
        (c)  Reserve Accounts.  Obligor's obligations under the Loan  
    Documents and Certificate and Indemnity also shall be secured by all  
    funds and investments in all of the accounts now or hereafter  
    established under the Loan Documents, including without limitation,  
    the Custodial Agreement, relating to the Obligor and specifically  
    including without limitation, the respective subaccounts related to  
    the Obligor Note in the Guaranteed Loan Funds Account, the Guaranteed  
    Loan Funds Investment Account, the Loan Repayment Account, the Loan  
    Repayment Investment Account, and the BEDI Grant Reserve Account (all  
    such accounts are collectively referred to herein as the "Reserve  
    Accounts," and all references to any such account, unless the context  
    clearly requires otherwise, shall refer to the subaccount thereof  
    related to the Obligor Note).  Obligor hereby pledges to the City, and  
    grants the City a security interest in, all right, title and interest  
    of Obligor, if any, in and to the funds and investments now or  
    hereafter in the Reserve Accounts, and all earnings thereon and  
    proceeds thereof.  Obligor agrees that such funds and other assets  
    shall constitute "cash collateral" as described in the United States  
    Bankruptcy Code. Obligor shall promptly take such actions as shall be  
    reasonably requested by the City or Custodian, and pay all fees and  
    costs reasonably required in order to perfect and continue perfection  
    as a first priority lien and security interest, so long as the Loan  
    remains outstanding, the City's security interest in such accounts,  
    the funds and investments therein, and the proceeds thereof.  Obligor  
    agrees that, in addition to all other rights and remedies with respect  
    to Reserve Accounts and otherwise under the Loan Documents,  
    immediately upon acceleration of the balance owing on the Loan,  
    whether upon an Event of Default or any other circumstance permitting  
    acceleration, the City shall have the absolute right, without notice  
    or demand, to apply all funds and assets pledged under this Section to  
    amounts owing under the Loan Documents, and for such purpose to  
    liquidate or cause to be liquidated any investments in any  
    commercially reasonable manner, and irrevocably authorizes any  
    Custodian, upon notice from the City of an Event of Default or any  
    other circumstance permitting acceleration, to comply with the City's  
    directions to so apply any or all such funds and assets and to  
    liquidate investments for such purpose.  
  
        (d)  Rights of City With Respect to Security.  Obligor  
    irrevocably agrees that, to the full extent permitted by applicable  
    law, and subject to rights of the Bank in accordance with the Deed of  
    Trust, the City may realize upon any security for the Loan either  
    before, concurrently with, or after either (1) any action to realize  
    upon any other form of security (including without limitation the Deed  
    of Trust and/or Letter of Credit), or (2) any suit or other proceeding  
    on the Obligor Note, in each case without affecting the status of or  
    waiving any rights or remedies under the Loan Documents or with  
    respect to any security.  Obligor consents to any and all actions that  
    the City or Custodian may take to release, subordinate, accept  
    substitution for, modify, compromise or waive any or all security with  
    respect to the Loan, and Obligor agrees that no such action shall  
    impair any rights or remedies of the City or Custodian under the Loan  
    Documents.  
  
        (e)  Collateral Assignments. The Loan shall be further  
    secured under a Collateral Assignment of Interest in Loan and Debt  
    Service Reserve Accounts and a Collateral Assignment of Leases and  
    Rents in form and substance required by HUD and acceptable to the City  
    (the "Collateral Assignments").  
  
      1.5  Loan Fee  .  Obligor shall pay to City a loan fee of  
    Thirteen Thousand and no/100 Dollars ($13,000.00), representing one  
    percent (1%) of the amount of the Loan, payable directly to City upon  
    and from the first disbursement of Loan funds hereunder, payment of  
    which loan fee is in addition to Obligor's duty to pay City's costs  
    and fees pursuant to Section 1.6 of this Agreement.  
  
      1.6  Obligor's Payment of Costs and Fees  .  Obligor shall pay  
    to City or at City's direction, as and when due, all other costs and  
    fees of whatever nature incurred by City (whether or not with recourse  
    to the City) in connection with the Loan, including without  
    limitation, fees and costs incurred by the City pursuant to the HUD  
    Contract and City Note (except for those items estimated below, to be  
    allocated on a pro rata basis according to the total principal amount  
    outstanding on the Obligor Note and the City Note at the time fees or  
    costs are incurred from time to time).  The costs and fees payable by  
    Obligor shall include, without limitation, (i) any and all charges and  
    costs billed by the Fiscal Agent in respect of the City Note under the  
    Amended and Restated Master Fiscal Agency Agreement among HUD and The  
    Chase Manhattan Bank (now known as JPMorgan Chase Bank) as Fiscal  
    Agent dated as of May 17, 2000; (ii) on and after the Conversion Date,  
    any charges and costs in respect of the City Note billed by the  
    trustee under that certain Trust Agreement by and between HUD and  
    Chemical Bank, as Trustee, dated as of January 1, 1995, as now and  
    hereafter amended and supplemented, and under any other trust  
    agreement or similar instrument that may be executed by HUD in  
    connection with a public offering conducted with respect to notes  
    guaranteed by HUD under the Section 108 program (each such offering is  
    referred to herein as a "Public Offering") that involves the City  
    Note, (iii) fees and costs of the Custodian in connection with the  
    Custodial Agreement, Letter Agreements and BEDI Grant Reserve Account;  
    (iv) fees and costs of the City's outside counsel and the Custodian's  
    outside counsel; (v) title insurance and escrow fees and costs in  
    connection with Closing; and (vi) fees and costs of the Bank in  
    connection with issuance of the Letter of Credit. Such fees and costs  
    as of the date of Closing are estimated (but not guaranteed) to be as  
    follows: Custodian's initial fee and first annual fee: $________;  
    City's outside counsel fees and costs: $________; Custodian's outside  
    counsel fees and costs: $_____; title insurance: $_______; escrow and  
    other costs: $_____; Bank fees and costs: __________.  These estimates  
    do not include the following, which shall also be paid by Obligor: the  
    fees described in Section 1.5; fees and costs of the Custodian, if  
    any, other than the initial set-up fee; and any fees or costs of the  
    City's outside counsel or Custodian's outside counsel incurred after  
    the date of Closing, including without limitation, in connection with  
    a Public Offering, and as may be incurred in case of breach or failure  
    to perform by Obligor or in case of any litigation arising in  
    connection with this Agreement.  
  
      1.7  City Funds Not Obligated  .  The Loan will be made only  
    from non-City funds that the Custodian receives under the HUD Contract  
    and City Note, and interest subsidy payments in accordance with  
    Section 4.6(b) hereof will be made only from available funds under the  
    BEDI Grant Agreement.  In accordance with RCW 35.21.735, the City  
    Note, and any payments or obligations under the HUD Contract and any  
    documents or agreements relating thereto, including without limitation  
    this Loan Agreement shall be a valid claim only against and payable  
    solely from, the Accounts held by the Custodian and from the security  
    pledged under the HUD Contract, and shall not be an obligation of The  
    City of Seattle or the State of Washington, and neither the faith and  
    credit nor the taxing power of the City or State or any municipal  
    corporation or subdivision of the State or any agency of any of the  
    foregoing is pledged to the payment of principal, interest or premium,  
    if any, on the City Note or for any amounts due under the HUD Contract  
    or any documents or agreements relating thereto including without  
    limitation this Agreement.  Nothing herein shall constitute a debt or  
    indebtedness of the City payable from public funds within the meaning  
    of any constitutional or statutory limitation on the incurrence of  
    debt.  Obligor agrees and acknowledges that this Agreement does not  
    create any recourse to or claim upon the City's general fund, or any  
    other funds of the City, and Obligor hereby disclaims any such claim.  
  
      1.8  Application of Payments  .  So long as the City or the  
    Custodian shall have received, in immediately available funds, timely  
    payments of interest and principal on the Obligor Note in the amounts  
    required thereunder, the City shall apply such payments to payment of  
    interest on and the principal of the City Note, as such interest and  
    principal shall become due.  
  
      1.9  Acceleration on Certain Events  .  The City shall have  
    the absolute right, in its discretion, to declare all or any part of  
    the principal balance owing on the Loan immediately due and payable in  
    the event that:  
  
        (a)  HUD or any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine  
    that the Loan or the issuance of the City Note must be terminated,  
    canceled or rescinded for failure to comply with the Act or other  
    applicable law, or that for any reason any City Note cannot be issued  
    or cannot be guaranteed by HUD; or  
  
        (b)  HUD shall notify the City that any or all of the City Note  
    cannot be included in the pool of notes for purposes of a scheduled  
    Public Offering for any reason, and that HUD or the holder of the City  
    Note is not willing to allow the interim terms of the City Note to  
    remain in effect pending a later public offering;  
  
    provided, that unless otherwise required by HUD or by the effect of a  
    court order, Obligor shall be allowed a period of ninety (90) days  
    after notice to Obligor thereof to seek to have such determination  
    reversed or rescinded, or the effect thereof stayed, prior to  
    acceleration of all or any part of the principal balance.  If any such  
    stay is obtained, then the City shall have the right to accelerate all  
    or part of the principal balance immediately upon the lifting or  
    termination of such stay.  
  
    ARTICLE II - OBLIGOR'S REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS   
  
  
      In order to induce City to make the Loan and enter into the HUD  
    Contract, Obligor represents, warrants and covenants as set forth  
    below in this Article II as of the date hereof, as of the date of  
    Closing, and at all times any of the principal of or interest on the  
    Loan remain outstanding.   These representations, warranties and  
    covenants shall survive the execution, delivery and performance of the  
    Loan Documents and of the Certificate and Indemnity, but shall  
    terminate upon the satisfaction of all of the obligations of Obligor  
    under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Certificate and  
    Indemnity, subject to revival after such satisfaction if any amount  
    paid under the Loan Documents or Certificate and Indemnity is  
    recaptured in bankruptcy or similar proceedings.  
  
      2.1  Organization of Obligor; Authority to Enter into Agreement    
    .  Obligor is a nonprofit corporation, duly organized and validly  
    existing pursuant to the laws of the State of Washington.  Obligor has  
    the right and power to purchase, own, develop and lease the Property  
    and to undertake the Project, and Obligor has full power and authority  
    to enter into this Agreement, to borrow money as contemplated herein  
    and to execute and perform the provisions of the Loan Documents and  
    the Certificate and Indemnity.  The execution, delivery and  
    performance of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the  
    Certificate and Indemnity have been duly authorized by all necessary  
    corporate action, and no other action of Obligor or any other party is  
    required for the execution, delivery and performance of this  
    Agreement, the other Loan Documents, or the Certificate and Indemnity.  
    This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Certificate and  
    Indemnity constitute valid and binding obligations of Obligor, each  
    enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.  
  
      2.2  Nondiscrimination, Fair Contracting Practices, WMBE  .  
  
        (a)  During the performance of this Loan Agreement, neither  
    Obligor nor any party contracting with Obligor in connection with the  
    Project  (whether or not to be paid from Loan funds) shall  
    discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national  
    origin, creed, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity,  
    age or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical handicap in  
    employment or application for employment or in the administration or  
    delivery of services or any other benefits under this Loan Agreement.  
    The Obligor shall comply fully with all applicable federal, state and  
    local laws, ordinances, executive orders and regulations that prohibit  
    such discrimination.  These laws include, but are not limited to,  
    Chapter 49.60 of the Revised Code of Washington, Titles VI and VII of  
    the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Chapter 14.04 of the Seattle  
    Municipal Code.  
  
        (b)  Each party is required to comply with the Fair Contracting  
    Practices Ordinance of The City of Seattle (Ordinance 119601), as  
    amended. Conduct made unlawful by that ordinance constitutes a breach  
    of contract. Engaging in an unfair contracting practice may also  
    result in the imposition of a civil fine or forfeiture under the  
    Seattle Criminal Code as well as various civil remedies.  
  
        (c)  Affirmative Efforts to Utilize WMBEs. The City encourages the  
    utilization of minority owned businesses ("MBEs") and women-owned  
    businesses ("WBEs") (collectively, "WMBEs"), in contracts funded by  
    the City.  The City encourages, and Obligor shall encourage with  
    respect to the Project, the following practices to open competitive  
    opportunities for WMBEs:  
  
    (1) Attending a pre-bid or pre-solicitation conference, if scheduled  
    by the City or Obligor, to provide project information and to inform  
    WMBEs of contracting and subcontracting opportunities.  
  
    (2) Placing all qualified WMBEs attempting to do business in the City  
    on solicitation lists, and providing written notice of subcontracting  
    opportunities to WMBEs capable of performing the work, including  
    without limitation all businesses on any list provided by the City, in  
    sufficient time to allow such businesses to respond to the written  
    solicitations.  
  
    (3) Breaking down total requirements into smaller tasks or quantities,  
    where economically feasible, in order to permit maximum participation  
    by small businesses including WMBEs.  
  
    (4) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirements of this  
    contract permit, that encourage participation by WMBEs.  
  
    (5) Providing WMBEs that express interest with adequate and timely  
    information about plans, specifications, and requirements of the  
    contract.  
  
    (6) Utilizing the services of available minority community  
    organizations, minority contractor groups, local minority assistance  
    offices, the City, and other organizations that provide assistance in  
    the recruitment and placement of WMBEs.  
  
    Obligor shall maintain, for at least twelve (12) months after  
    completion of the Project, all bids or proposals from general

    (a)  Program Income.  "Program Income" is defined at 24 CFR  
    Section 570.500(a) and includes, without limitation, gross income from  
    the use or rental of property acquired or improved with CDBG funds,  
    less costs incidental to the generation of the income.  Obligor shall  
    report all Program Income received in its annual report to the City  
    and shall maintain complete records on all Program Income.  Unless  
    specified otherwise in this Agreement, Program Income (as defined in  
    24 C.F.R. Section 570.500(a)) shall be promptly paid to the City.  
    Payments made on the Loan, by or on behalf of Obligor, shall be  
    construed to include any Program Income received prior to each such  
    payment, up to the amount of each such payment.   All payments of  
    Program Income shall be applied to any balance owing on the Loan.  The  
    obligation of Obligor under this subsection to pay Program Income to  
    the City shall continue until the Loan is repaid in full, and shall  
    then terminate, except that (1) pursuant to 24 CFR Section  
    570.503(b)(3), at the end of any year, upon the City's request,  
    Obligor shall remit to the City Program Income balances (including  
    investments of Program Income) held by Obligor, after deducting  
    therefrom amounts necessary for Obligor's immediate cash needs; and  
    (2) to the extent required by 24 CFR Section 570.504, any Program  
    Income on hand when this Agreement expires or received after such  
    expiration, shall be paid to the City.  If Obligor receives any  
    Program Income that it is not required to pay to the City under this  
    subsection, the Obligor shall use such Program Income for the  
    development of the Project, or for the costs of the operation of the  
    Property for the purposes described in this Agreement, and all  
    provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the activities for which  
    the Program Income is used.  
  
    (b)  Reversion of Assets.  Upon the expiration of this Agreement  
    Obligor shall transfer to City any CDBG funds relating to this Project  
    on hand at the time of expiration and any accounts receivable  
    attributable to the use of CDBG funds relating to this Project.  
    Either (i) the Property shall be used solely for the purposes  
    described in Section 5.7(a) and Attachment B to this Agreement, or  
    otherwise to meet one of the national objectives in 24 C.F.R. Section  
    570.208 in a manner approved by the City, until five years after  
    expiration of this Agreement, or (ii) if the Property is not used  
    solely as described in clause (i), the Obligor shall promptly pay to  
    the City an amount equal to the current market value of the Property  
    less any portion of the value attributable to expenditures of non-CDBG  
    funds for acquisition of, or improvements to, the Property.  Any  
    amount paid pursuant to this subsection B shall be applied to  
    repayment of amounts then due or thereafter coming due on the Loan,  
    and any excess after full repayment of the Loan shall be retained by  
    the City for CDBG-eligible purposes.  This subsection shall be  
    construed so as to be consistent with 24 CFR Section 570.503(b)(8) and  
    any interpretations thereof by HUD.  
  
    (c)  Cost Accounting and Administrative Requirements; Procurement  
    .  Obligor shall comply with those provisions of the following OMB

    No audit costs shall be allowable for audits not required under  
    Circular A-133, except as expressly provided in Circular A-133.  In  
    cases of failure to have a proper audit conducted in accordance with  
    Circular A-133, failure to provide a timely audit report, or failure  
    to take timely corrective action to resolve any findings, Obligor will  
    be subject to appropriate sanction.

    addition to the audit report, Obligor shall provide a copy of the  
    audit management letter and a report of its comments on the findings  
    and recommendations in the report, including a plan for corrective  
    action if necessary.  The Obligor shall initiate corrective action to  
    resolve all findings within six (6) months of the receipt of the audit  
    report, and shall complete the resolution of all findings, consistent  
    with any management decision made by the City pursuant to Circular A-  
    133, as rapidly as possible and in any event no later than twelve (12)  
    months after receipt of the audit report.

    costs allocable to the City Note, any remaining amount in the  
    Guaranteed Loan Funds Account shall be transferred to the Loan  
    Repayment Account maintained by the Custodian under the Letter  
    Agreements ("Loan Repayment Account"), and the next deposit(s)  
    required to the Loan Repayment Account in respect of principal under  
    Section 4.6 below shall be reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount  
    of such transfer.  In any event all amounts remaining in the  
    Guaranteed Loan Funds Account on   N/A/   shall be transferred  
    to the Loan Repayment Account unless otherwise agreed by HUD and the  
    City.  If the Obligor Note shall be paid in full prior to the  
    Conversion Date, the amount so withheld, and earnings thereon, shall  
    be applied as part of such prepayment of the Obligor Note and  
    transferred to the Loan Repayment Account to redeem the City Note.  
    The City may elect, in its sole discretion, to waive the foregoing  
    requirement upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the City that the  
    payment of such costs has otherwise been duly provided for and that  
    funds necessary to pay such costs will be available when needed.  If  
    no funds are held back pursuant to this Section then Obligor shall  
    deliver to the Custodian, by the later of the date ___ days prior to  
    the date set for a Public Offering that will include the City Note, or  
    __ days after the date of notice thereof to Obligor, the Obligor's  
    prorata share of Public Offering costs as determined by the City or  
    Custodian based on information from HUD.  If Obligor does not timely  
    deliver such amount, then the City may direct the Custodian to pay the  
    Obligor's share of Public Offering costs from any of the Reserve  
    Accounts, any other provision of the Loan Documents notwithstanding,  
    and the Obligor shall replenish such Reserve Account(s) on demand.  
  
      4.4  Request for Interim Funding Advance; Cancellation upon Failure  
    to Satisfy Closing Conditions; Payment of City's Costs  .  
    Obligor understands that, pursuant to current HUD procedures, an  
    interim funding advance on the City Note can be made only on a  
    Wednesday and only if a request for such advance is made by the City  
    to HUD consistent with the timing requirements of the Fiscal Agency  
    Agreement and with any additional advance notice that HUD may require,  
    and that after a request has been submitted it may not be possible to  
    cancel the request.  The Obligor shall deliver to the City, no later  
    than fifteen  (15) Business Days prior to the Wednesday on which  
    Obligor desires an advance of funds hereunder, an "Obligor's Request  
    for Submission of City's Request for Interim Advance of Funds" in form  
    acceptable to the City.  The City shall not be required to submit a  
    request for funds to HUD unless the City has received reasonable  
    assurance that all other conditions to closing will be satisfied by  
    the date of disbursement by HUD.  If the City does submit a request  
    for funds to HUD, the City shall not be liable or responsible for any  
    failure or delay by HUD, the Fiscal Agent or the interim purchaser of  
    the City Note, or for any delay in the process of transferring funds  
    to the Custodian and to the escrow agent.  If Obligor submits such  
    request and funds are disbursed by HUD on the City Note, but the  
    conditions to disbursement of funds to Obligor are not fully satisfied  
    within fifteen (15) days thereafter, then the City shall have the  
    right to cancel this Agreement, and Obligor shall then pay on demand  
    all fees and costs of the Custodian and Fiscal Agent, and shall  
    reimburse the City for all reasonable fees and costs of its outside  
    counsel and consultants incurred in connection with this Loan, but  
    shall not be liable for the Loan fee described in Section 1.5 of this  
    Agreement.  In addition, if this Loan Agreement shall be canceled  
    under this Section after proceeds of the City Note shall have been  
    disbursed to the Custodian, then the Obligor shall pay to the  
    Custodian on demand an amount equal to all interest that shall accrue  
    on the City Note from the date of such disbursement to the date of  
    redemption thereof, less net earnings actually received (if any) by  
    the Custodian on the proceeds of the City Note prior to such  
    redemption.  
  
      4.5  Reserved  .  
  
      4.6  Loan Repayment Account  .  
  
        (a)  Monthly Deposits.  Commencing in the first month  
    disbursement of principal of the City Note in respect of the Obligor  
    Note is to be made, Obligor shall make monthly installment payments to  
    the Custodian for deposit in an account maintained by the Custodian  
    for the accumulation of funds for payments on the Obligor Note (the  
    "Loan Repayment Account," established under the Custodial Agreement  
    and Letter Agreements), in order that the Custodian shall have  
    sufficient funds to pay installments on the Obligor Note as they come  
    due (each such due date being an "Obligor Note Payment Date").  (Funds  
    in the Loan Repayment Account shall be used to make payments on the  
    City Note as they come due.) Each such monthly payment shall be due  
    and payable, in immediately available funds, on the "Deposit Day,"  
    which shall be the fifteenth (15th) day of the month, or if such day  
    is not a Business Day, then on the previous Business Day; subject to  
    adjustment in respect of any Conversion Date.  Subject to the  
    provisions of Section 4.6(b) hereof, each such payment shall be in an  
    amount equal to the actual interest accruing on the Obligor Note  
    during the corresponding month, at the rate or blended rate, as the  
    case may be, then in effect (the "Interest Component"), plus one-  
    twelfth (1/12th) of the total principal coming due on the Obligor Note  
    on the next Obligor Note Payment Date (the "Principal Component");  
    provided that the monthly payment obligation in respect of the  
    Interest Component shall be adjusted ratably in any month the Loan is  
    not outstanding for the entire month; and provided further, that the  
    monthly payment obligation in respect of the Principal Component shall  
    be adjusted ratably during any period that fewer than twelve (12)  
    Deposit Days are scheduled to occur prior to the corresponding Obligor  
    Note Payment Date in respect of principal of the Obligor Note.  Except  
    as provided in Section 4.6(b) below, Obligor shall not be entitled to  
    any reductions in, or credits against, deposits to the Loan Repayment  
    Account based upon interest or earnings credited to the Loan Repayment  
    Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account or the BEDI Grant  
    Reserve Account.  The Obligor hereby irrevocably assigns all of its  
    right, title and interest, if any, in funds deposited in the  
    subaccounts of the Loan Repayment Account, Loan Repayment Investment  
    Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account related to the Obligor Note, to  
    the Custodian and the City, and shall have no residual interest in any  
    portion of such Reserves.  
  
        (b)  Interest Stabilization Payments and Subsidy.  Obligor  
    and the City intend, notwithstanding the actual rate of interest  
    payable on the Loan and Obligor Note from time to time, that to the  
    extent feasible, Obligor's monthly Interest Component payment  
    obligations shall be based upon a deemed rate of interest equal to  
    four percent (4.0%) per annum.  If the rate or blended rate as the  
    case may be of interest on the Loan and Obligor Note during any month  
    is less than four percent (4.0%) per annum, Obligor shall pay to the  
    Custodian on the corresponding Deposit Day, as the Interest Component  
    for deposit into the Loan Repayment Account, an amount equal to the  
    Interest Component payment that would have been due on the Loan and  
    Obligor Note on such date had the rate during such period been four  
    percent (4.0%) per annum, notwithstanding that the actual interest  
    accruing on the Obligor Note during such period may be less.  If the  
    actual rate of interest on the Loan and Obligor Note during any month  
    exceeds four percent (4.0%) per annum, unless the Custodian shall have  
    delivered to Obligor and City a Shortfall Notice (defined in this  
    Section, below), Obligor shall pay to the Custodian on the  
    corresponding Deposit Day, interest at a rate equal to four percent  
    (4.0%) per annum on the then-Outstanding principal balance of the Loan  
    and Obligor Note, and the Custodian shall look to other funds on  
    deposit in the Loan Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment  
    Account and the BEDI Grant Reserve Account to pay the balance of  
    interest next scheduled to become due on the City Loan; provided, that  
    the Custodian shall exhaust funds on deposit in the Loan Repayment  
    Account and the Loan Repayment Investment Account from time to time  
    prior to making any withdrawals from the BEDI Grant Reserve Account to  
    pay any portion of the Interest Component of any monthly deposit; and  
    provided further, that Custodian is not authorized to and shall not  
    withdraw from the BEDI Grant Reserve Account for such purposes, an  
    aggregate amount greater than One Hundred Forty-Six Thousand Seven  
    Hundred Seventy-Four and no/100 Dollars ($146,774.00)  plus the  
    investment earnings thereon, if any.  If not less than five (5)  
    Business Days prior to any Deposit Day the Custodian determines that  
    there shall or may be insufficient funds available in the Loan  
    Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account and the BEDI  
    Grant Reserve Account to pay the full amount of principal and interest  
    to become due on the City Note on the next date such interest is  
    required to be paid, taking into account the expected payment of  
    interest at a deemed rate of four percent (4.0%) per annum required to  
    be made by Obligor on such Deposit Day and each subsequent Deposit Day  
    scheduled to occur prior to the corresponding Obligor Note Payment  
    Date, the Custodian shall promptly deliver written notice (each, a  
    "Shortfall Notice") to that effect to the Obligor (with a copy to the  
    City).  Upon receipt of any such Shortfall Notice, and in any event,  
    on or before the corresponding Deposit Day, the Obligor shall pay to  
    the Custodian, for deposit into the Loan Repayment Account, as the  
    Interest Component, the full amount of interest actually accruing on  
    the Loan and Obligor Note during the corresponding month.  If a  
    Shortfall Notice shall be given after the Conversion Date then,  
    without necessity for any further Shortfall Notice, Obligor shall on  
    each Deposit Day thereafter pay to the Custodian, for deposit into the  
    Loan Repayment Account, as the Interest Component, an amount equal to  
    interest at the greater of 4% per annum or the actual blended rate of  
    interest for the corresponding month. Obligor acknowledges and agrees  
    that interest stabilization payments made by Obligor in accordance  
    with this Section 4.6(b) and deposited in the Loan Repayment Account,  
    together with the earnings thereon, if any, shall be held, without  
    right of withdrawal or reimbursement.  
  
        (c)  Transfers Authorized; Crediting Payments on Obligor Note  
    .  The Custodian is hereby irrevocably authorized to transfer from  
    the Loan Repayment Investment Account to the Loan Repayment Account on  
    each Obligor Note Payment Date, funds in the full amount due on the  
    Obligor Note on each such date, and from the BEDI Grant Reserve  
    Account, the amounts described in Section 4.6(b).  The Custodian is  
    then authorized and directed to apply funds in the Loan Repayment  
    Account to the timely payment of amounts due on the City Note.  The  
    Obligor further agrees that upon direction of the City, the Custodian  
    may apply funds in the BEDI Grant Reserve Account to make any payments  
    on the Obligor Note for which there are insufficient funds in the Loan  
    Repayment Account as a result of failure by Obligor to pay funds to  
    the Custodian for deposit therein as required hereunder, but no  
    application of any funds in any account to payments on this Note shall  
    waive or reduce any such required payments from Obligor. Obligor's  
    monthly installment payments into the Loan Repayment Account shall not  
    constitute payments under the Obligor Note.  Obligor shall be credited  
    with the payment of interest and principal on the Obligor Note only  
    when and solely to the extent that funds on deposit and/or transferred  
    to the Loan Repayment Account under this Section 4.6(c) are applied to  
    the payment of the allocable portion of the City Note.   The Custodian  
    is further irrevocably authorized by Obligor to liquidate investments  
    in the Loan Repayment Investment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve  
    Account, in the Custodian's discretion, and without liability for any  
    loss on any such liquidation, for the purposes described in this  
    Section 4.6(c).  The authorization by Obligor in this Section 4.6(c)  
    is in addition to, and not in limitation of, the authorization in  
    Section 1.4 above.  
  
        (d)  Investment of Funds; Earnings Remain on Deposit.  Funds  
    in the Loan Repayment Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account shall be  
    invested at the direction of City, but only in instruments that mature  
    (or are redeemable without penalty) within six (6) months and in any  
    event no later than five (5) Business Days before the next Obligor  
    Note Payment Date, and that are guaranteed as to payment of principal  
    by the United States Government, or in money market funds that invest  
    solely in such instruments.  All earnings in the Loan Repayment  
    Account and BEDI Grant Reserve Account shall remain therein until  
    applied in accordance with this Agreement or until all amounts owing  
    under the Loan Documents have been paid in full.  When all amounts  
    owing under the Loan Documents have been paid in full, then the  
    remaining balance shall be disbursed to or upon the order of the City.  
  
        (e)  Late Charge.  If any deposit required to be made into  
    the Loan Repayment Account is not received within ten (10) days after  
    the date when such deposit is due, in addition to additional interest  
    required to be paid in accordance with the Obligor Note, Obligor  
    agrees to pay a late charge equal to five percent (5.0%) of the amount  
    past due, as compensation to the City and Custodian for the staff time  
    and resources required to handle such delinquencies, and not as a  
    penalty.  Such late charges shall not be credited to the Loan  
    Repayment Account, but shall be retained by the City and/or Custodian.  
    Late charges under this Section are in addition to, and not in  
    substitution for, the other remedies provided in the Loan Documents.  
  
    [  
  
      4.7  Application of Payments  . Any amounts to be applied to  
    the Obligor Note in accordance with this Agreement shall be applied  
    first to accrued interest on the Obligor Note, next to any premium  
    then due, and the balance, if any, to reduction of principal.  
  
    ARTICLE V - OBLIGOR'S LOAN COVENANTS  
  
      In addition to other obligations of the Obligor hereunder, Obligor  
    covenants and agrees as follows:  
  
      5.1  General  .  From and after the date hereof and so long as  
    any amount remains unpaid on the Obligor Note, or for so long as any  
    commitment exists to extend credit hereunder, Obligor covenants and  
    agrees that it will:  
  
        (a)  Promptly pay principal, interest and premium (if any)  
    pursuant to the Obligor Note as and when the same becomes due and  
    payable, and make any and all other payments and deposits required by  
    the Loan Documents;  
  
        (b)  Preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence as a  
    nonprofit corporation under the laws of the State of Washington;  
  
        (c)  Maintain, preserve and keep the Property, improvements  
    thereon, and all equipment used in connection therewith in good  
    repair, working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted,  
    and from time to time make all necessary repairs, renewals,  
    replacements and additions thereto so that at all times the efficiency  
    thereof shall be fully preserved and maintained.  
  
      5.2  Reserved  .  
  
      5.3  Compliance with Laws  .  All use and operation of the  
    Property and Project, and all work performed in connection with the  
    Property and Project shall comply in all material respects with all  
    applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and executive  
    orders of federal, state, county or municipal governments or agencies  
    now in force or which may be enacted hereafter.  
  
      5.4  Inspections  .  City and its representatives shall have  
    the right, subject to the rights of tenants on the Property, at all  
    reasonable times after three (3) days' prior written notice during  
    regular business hours (and at any time in the event of an emergency)  
    to enter upon the Property and inspect the Property to determine that  
    the same is in conformity with this Agreement and all laws,  
    ordinances, rules and regulations.  City shall have the further right,  
    from time to time, to inspect and copy Obligor's books and records  
    relating to the Property.  Without limiting the foregoing, Obligor  
    shall permit City to examine and copy all books, records and other  
    papers relating to Obligor's use of the Loan proceeds and to Obligor's  
    compliance with this Agreement, the Act and applicable provisions of  
    federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.  
  
      5.5  Notify City of Litigation or Complaints  .  Obligor shall  
    promptly notify City in writing of all litigation or threatened  
    litigation involving the Property or any part of the Property, and any  
    other litigation that reasonably could have a material adverse affect  
    on the financial condition of Obligor, and of all complaints or  
    charges made by any governmental authority affecting the Property or  
    Obligor which may require changes in the development or use of the  
    Property.  
  
      5.6  Waiver of Immunity  .  
  
    Obligor waives, after mutual negotiation, and with respect to the City  
    only, its immunity under RCW Title 51, Industrial Insurance.  
  
    Initials: Obligor: ____    City: _____  
  
      5.7  Federal Regulations  .  Obligor acknowledges that the  
    Loan is to be made with funds received by the Custodian under the  
    Section 108 program of the Act and that such funds are subject to CDBG  
    program regulations of HUD, and certain other federal laws and  
    regulations.  Accordingly, Obligor agrees, represents and warrants  
    that Obligor shall comply with all applicable requirements under HUD  
    regulations for the CDBG program and under other laws and regulations  
    applicable to loans of such federal funds, including without  
    limitation:  
  
        (a)  Benefit to Low- and Moderate Income Individuals.  
    Obligor's development of the Property and its housing units shall  
    benefit low- and moderate-income persons (as defined by HUD for CDBG  
    purposes) to the maximum extent feasible.  Obligor shall ensure that  
    at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the housing units to be developed  
    on the Property are initially occupied upon completion by "low- and  
    moderate-income households," as defined in 24 CFR Section 570.3  
    ("LMIHs"), as tenants at rental rates that are affordable to LMIHs.  
    For purposes of this Section, a rental housing unit shall be  
    considered affordable if the total monthly rent, including a  
    reasonable allowance approved by the City for any utilities to be paid  
    by the tenant, does not exceed one-twelfth of thirty percent (30%) of  
    the income limit published by HUD for an LMIH with a presumed family  
    size based on the size of unit, as follows: studio -- one person; one-  
    bedroom, 1.5 persons; two bedrooms - 3 persons; three bedrooms - 4.5  
    persons; four bedrooms - 6 persons.  Where the presumed family size is  
    not an integer, the average of the income limits for the next higher  
    and lower integral family sizes will be used.  For purposes of  
    determining whether a family or household is an LMIH, Obligor shall  
    use the method required by 24 CFR Section 570.3 and shall use the  
    definition of annual income set forth in subsection (1) (i) in the  
    definition of "income" under Section 570.3.  
  
  
  
         (b)  Nondiscrimination.  No person shall on the grounds  
    of race, color, national origin, religion or sex be excluded from  
    participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to  
    discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in  
    part with CDBG funds.  Obligor shall comply fully with all  
    requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  
    2000d et seq., which provides that no person in the United  
    States shall on the ground of race, color or national origin, be  
    excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or be  
    subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving  
    Federal financial assistance; and with Department of Housing and Urban  
    Development ("HUD") regulations implementing such requirements, 24  
    C.F.R. Part 1.  
  
        Obligor shall comply with all applicable requirements and  
    prohibitions of the following: 24 C.F.R. Section 570.602, implementing  
    the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 109 of the Act; HUD  
    regulations under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 24  
    C.F.R. Part 8; HUD Regulations under the Americans with Disabilities  
    Act; and HUD regulations under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 42  
    U.S.C. Section 6101 et  seq., at 24 C.F.R. Part 146.  
  
        No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States  
    shall, solely by reason of handicap, be excluded from the  
    participation in, be denied the benefits, or be subjected to  
    discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal  
    financial assistance.  
  
        (c)  Conflict of Interest.  Obligor shall ensure compliance  
    with the provisions of 24 CFR Section 570.611, which provide generally  
    that no officer, agent, employee, consultant or elected or appointed  
    official of The City of Seattle or of any subrecipient receiving CDBG  
    funds who exercises or has exercised any functions or responsibilities  
    with respect to activities assisted by CDBG funds or who is in a  
    position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside  
    information with respect to these activities, shall obtain any  
    financial interest or benefit from, or have any  financial interest  
    in, the activity funded under this Loan Agreement or any contract or  
    subcontract or agreement with respect thereto or the proceeds thereof,  
    for himself or herself or those with whom he or she has business or  
    immediate family ties; nor shall (s)he for one year after completion  
    of his or her tenure with the City or such subrecipient obtain or have  
    any such financial interest or benefit.  Obligor shall incorporate in  
    all such contracts or subcontracts a provision prohibiting any  
    conflict of interest prohibited by this subsection.  
  
        (d)  Debarred Contractors.  No portion of the Loan shall be  
    used directly or indirectly to employ, award contracts to, or  
    otherwise engage the services of, or fund, any contractor or  
    subrecipient during any period of debarment, suspension, or placement  
    in ineligibility status of such contractor or subrecipient under the  
    provisions of 24 C.F.R. Part 24.  Obligor represents and warrants that  
    neither Obligor nor its principals is debarred, suspended, proposed  
    for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from  
    participation in federal assistance programs under such regulations or  
    Executive Order 12549, "Debarment and Suspension."  Obligor shall  
    obtain, and shall require contractors and subcontractors to obtain,  
    the certification required by appendix B of 24 CFR part 24 from each  
    prospective contractor or subcontractor on the Project.  
  
        (e)  Lobbying.  Obligor hereby certifies and agrees as  
    follows, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. Section 1352, to the best of its  
    knowledge and belief:  
  
          (1)  No Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be  
    paid, by or on behalf of Obligor, to any person for influencing or  
    attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member  
    of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a  
    member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any Federal  
    contract, the making of any Federal loan, the entering into of any  
    cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal,  
    amendment, or modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or  
    cooperative agreement;  
  
          (2)  If any funds other than Federal appropriated funds have  
    been paid or will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting  
    to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of  
    Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a  
    member of Congress in connection with this Federal loan, it will  
    complete and submit Standard Form-LLL, "Disclosure Form to Report  
    Lobbying," in accordance with its instructions; and  
  
          (3)  It will require that the language of this Section be  
    included in the award documents for subawards at all tiers (including  
    subcontracts, subgrants, and contracts under grants, loans and  
    cooperative agreements) and that all subrecipients shall certify and  
    disclose accordingly.  
  
        This certification is a material representation of fact upon which  
    reliance was placed when this transaction was made or entered into.  
    Submission of this certification is made a prerequisite for making or  
    entering into this transaction by section 1352, title 31, U. S. Code.

    with any and all applicable requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and  
    related acts.  These requirements include, but are not limited to:  
    language within each contract for construction work; payment of  
    prevailing wages and fringe benefits; the submittal of various  
    documents as evidence of compliance; withholding of funds; equal

        The requirements are defined in the:  Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C.  
    Section 276(a) et seq.; Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards  
    Act, 40 U.S.C. Section 328 et seq.; Copeland Act (Anti-Kickback  
    Act), 18 U.S.C. Section 874; the Fair Labor Standards Act, and  
    regulations under such Acts, including 29 C.F.R. Parts 3 and 5.  
  
        (g)  Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons  
    .  Obligor shall comply, and cause all contractors and  
    subcontractors to comply, with any and all applicable provisions of  
    Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as  
    amended, 12 U.S.C. 1701u, the purpose of which is to ensure that  
    employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal  
    financial assistance for housing and community development programs  
    shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and  
    very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of  
    government assistance for housing.  Obligor shall comply, and shall  
    require all contractors and subcontractors to comply, with all  
    applicable provisions of regulations issued pursuant thereto by the  
    Secretary of HUD and set forth in 24 C.F.R. Part 135, and with all  
    applicable rules and orders of HUD issued thereunder.  
  
        (h)  Relocation and Acquisition.  Obligor represents,  
    warrants and agrees that no residential tenants have been or will be  
    displaced in connection with the Project and the Obligor has taken and  
    shall take all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of  
    persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations,  
    and farms) in connection with the Project. Obligor represents and  
    warrants that Obligor has provided to City a complete and accurate  
    list of all occupants of the Property as of the date that Obligor  
    obtained site control, and Obligor shall provide a complete and  
    accurate list of all persons occupying the Property at any time after  
    site control and through the date of full occupancy after Project  
    completion. Obligor shall comply fully, at Obligor's sole expense,  
    with the City's Residential Anti-displacement and Relocation  
    Assistance Plan ("RARAP").  If the Project involves the temporary  
    and/or permanent displacement of persons, Obligor represents, warrants  
    and agrees that Obligor has provided and shall provide, at a minimum,  
    all relocation assistance required by 24 CFR Section 42; the federal  
    Uniform Relocation Act and regulations thereunder, 49 CFR Part 24; 24  
    CFR Section 570.606 and any other applicable federal laws or  
    regulations, and shall maintain complete and accurate records  
    demonstrating such compliance.  Obligor agrees that any determination  
    by City of the amount of relocation assistance due to any person shall  
    be final and binding upon Obligor, unless a different determination is  
    made by HUD at the request of such person, in which case the HUD  
    determination shall be final and binding on Obligor.  Obligor agrees  
    that the City may, at its option, provide relocation assistance  
    directly to any person in connection with the Project and that any  
    payment by the City for such person shall, at City's option,  
    constitute an advance on the Loan, without any requirement for a draw  
    request by, or consent of, Obligor.  If, as a result of any such  
    direct payments, either (i) the amount advanced by City shall exceed  
    the maximum Loan amount stated herein, or (ii) the amount expended on  
    relocation assistance from all Project funding sources exceeds the  
    amount provided in the Project Budget for relocation, then in either  
    such case the excess shall be immediately due and payable by Obligor  
    to City, at City's demand.  Obligor represents and warrants that,  
    except as expressly stated in a relocation plan submitted by Obligor  
    to City in connection with this Loan, no residential tenants have been  
    required to vacate or will be required to vacate the Property  
    permanently because of the Project.  Obligor shall carry out the terms  
    of any relocation plan approved by City, but the terms of any such  
    plan shall not limit Obligor's obligations under this Loan Agreement  
    or applicable laws or regulations, and no such approval by City shall  
    be construed as a waiver or modification of any requirement of this  
    Agreement or applicable laws or regulations.  
  
        (i)  Architectural Barriers.  Obligor shall ensure that the  
    Property, upon completion of the Project, shall comply with the  
    applicable requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (see  
    42 U.S.C. Sections 4151-57), and shall comply with the Uniform Federal  
    Accessibility Standards (Appendix A to 24 CFR part 40 for residential  
    structures, and Appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19, subpart 101-19.6,  
    for general type buildings).  
  
        (j)  Records.  Obligor shall maintain and make available to  
    the City and HUD all records reasonably required to demonstrate  
    compliance with all of the requirements of this Agreement, for at  
    least four (4) years after full repayment of the Loan.  Such records  
    shall include, without limitation, records establishing the household  
    size of, household income of, unit occupancy by, and rents charged to,  
    all households in occupancy of the Property from immediately after the  
    acquisition thereof, up to and including the dated immediately after  
    the completion of the Project.  
  
        (k)  Disclosures.  Obligor represents, warrants and agrees  
    that it has provided to OH any and all disclosures required by the HUD  
    Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 3545, and regulations thereunder, 24 CFR  
    Part 4; that it will provide timely updated disclosures to OH to the  
    extent required by such act and regulations; and that all such  
    disclosures are and shall be complete and accurate.  
  
        (l)  Prior Actions.  Obligor represents and warrants that in  
    all actions related to the Project to date Obligor has complied with  
    all requirements referred to in this Section 5.7.  
  
        (m)  Indemnity.  Obligor shall indemnify and hold harmless  
    the City from any loss, damage, expense, claim or demand resulting  
    from Obligor's failure to comply with any federal requirement to be  
    complied with pursuant to this Agreement or failure to maintain  
    adequate records to demonstrate such compliance.  This provision shall  
    survive expiration of this Agreement.  
  
      5.8  Reports  .  Obligor shall deliver to the City reports and  
    information as City may require for purposes of monitoring and  
    evaluating the performance of the Obligor, which may include copies of  
    tenant certifications, rent rolls, leases, property management  
    agreements and any other contracts affecting the Property.  
  
      5.9  Liens or Claims of Liens  .  Obligor shall keep the  
    Property free from liens and encumbrances of all kinds, superior or  
    inferior to the Deed of Trust, except for those permitted pursuant to  
    Section 2.4 above and any of the following:  
  
    (a)  Liens for property taxes on the Property not yet due and payable;  
  
    (b)  The rights of tenants as tenants only under leases entered into  
    in the ordinary course of Obligor's operation of the Property and in  
    accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, but only  
    to the extent that such leases are subordinate to the lien of the Deed  
    of Trust, to the Leases (as defined herein), and to any other material  
    leases, which subordinate status shall be insured by endorsement to  
    the City's title insurance policy, at Obligor's expense, within thirty  
    (30) days of request to Obligor by the City; and  
  
    (c)  Liens subordinate to the lien of the Deed of Trust, created after  
    the date of Closing with the prior written consent of the City, which  
    consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  
  
    If any claims of lien shall be asserted against the Property other  
    than as permitted by this Section, Obligor, regardless of any action  
    that City may otherwise be authorized to take, shall obtain a release  
    and satisfaction of such lien claim, bond the lien claim, procure  
    title insurance satisfactory to City protecting City from any loss  
    relating to such lien claim, or otherwise provide to City assurances  
    and security satisfactory to City that the lien claim will be paid or  
    satisfied not later than ten (10) days after a judgment on the lien  
    claim.  Provided Obligor complies with the previous sentence, Obligor  
    may in good faith contest any worker's or material supplier's lien in  
    legal proceedings that will prevent enforcement of the lien claim and  
    prevent foreclosure of the Property.  If such a lien claim is not  
    released or satisfied or a bond or other security satisfactory to City  
    provided within forty-five (45) days of written request from City to  
    Obligor, then the failure to do so shall allow the City to declare an  
    Event of Default (as defined in Section 6.1 below) regardless of  
    whether such lien claim is or is not superior to the Deed of Trust.  
  
      5.10  Political Activity  .  No portion of the Loan shall be  
    used for any political activity or to further the election or defeat  
    of any candidate for public office or to influence the approval or  
    defeat of any ballot issue or legislation.  
  
      5.11  Further Actions  .  Obligor will at any time and from  
    time to time upon request of City take or cause to be taken any  
    action, execute, acknowledge, deliver or record any further documents,  
    opinions, or other instruments or obtain such additional insurance as  
    City is required to do or obtain by HUD or other federal, state or  
    county regulatory agency.  
  
      5.12  Reserved  .  
  
      5.13  Payment of Compensation of Custodian  .  Obligor shall  
    be responsible for and pay its prorata portion of the fees of the  
    Custodian as provided under the Custodial Agreement.  The Custodian's  
    acceptance fee, prorated first annual fee and counsel fees and  
    expenses shall be disbursed to Custodian from the Guaranteed Loan  
    Funds Account at the time of initial Loan disbursement.  Thereafter,  
    Obligor shall promptly pay the Custodian's fees and expenses directly  
    to the Custodian.  
  
      5.14  Payment of Other Indebtedness  .  Obligor shall timely  
    pay the principal, interest and all other amounts due on any other  
    indebtedness or liability now or hereafter owing by the Obligor to any  
    person and secured by the Property; provided, that nothing in this  
    Section shall authorize Obligor to make any payment from any funds or  
    assets pledged to the City hereunder.  
  
      5.15  Transfer of Property  .  Obligor shall not cause or  
    permit any transfer of the Property or any interest of Obligor  
    therein, voluntary or involuntary, without the advance written consent  
    of the City, except for the creation of liens, encumbrances or leases  
    that are expressly permitted under the Loan Documents without the  
    City's consent.  
  
    ARTICLE VI - DEFAULT AND REMEDIES  
  
      6.1  Events of Default  .  Upon the occurrence of any of the  
    following events and prior to the complete cure thereof by Obligor in  
    a manner satisfactory to the City, the City shall have the right to  
    declare an Event of Default hereunder, without notice or demand by  
    City, except as expressly provided in this Section:  
  
        (a)  Any failure to pay when due any deposit into the Loan  
    Repayment Account in respect of principal or interest on the Obligor  
    Note;

    6.1(a) above, that is not cured within ten (10) days of the due date  
    of such payment or deposit (or within ten (10) days of demand in case  
    of amounts due on demand);

    voluntary or involuntary, contrary to Section 5.15 of this Loan  
    Agreement;  
  
        (d)  Any failure to comply with the terms of Section 5.9 of this  
    Loan Agreement (relating to lien claims) within the time period  
    permitted by such Section;  
  
        (e)  Obligor's abandonment of the Project, or failure to complete  
    the Project and to deliver to the City, a Certificate of Occupancy for  
    the new building on the Property permitting its use for the purposes  
    described in Attachment B, not less than ____ days prior to the stated  
    expiration date of the Letter of Credit (including any extensions  
    thereof obtained in accordance with the terms of the Reimbursement  
    Agreement);  
  
        (f)  Any breach or nonperformance by Obligor of any provision of  
    any of the Loan Documents not included within any of Subsections (a)-  
    (e) above that is not cured within sixty (60) days after notice to  
    Obligor of such breach or nonperformance, or such longer cure period  
    as may be permitted under the specific terms of the Loan Document;  
    provided, however, that unless HUD shall otherwise require, if (1)  
    such breach or nonperformance is susceptible to cure but cannot  
    reasonably be cured within such cure period, (2) Obligor shall  
    commence to cure such breach or nonperformance within such cure period  
    and shall thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceed to cure the  
    same, and (3) Obligor shall inform the City in writing of the status  
    of the cure at the expiration of such cure period and every thirty  
    days thereafter, then such cure period shall be extended for such time  
    as is reasonably necessary for Obligor in the exercise of due  
    diligence to cure such breach or nonperformance;  
  
        (g)  A petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or for an  
    arrangement under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or for a receiver  
    or trustee for any of Obligor's property is filed by Obligor, or is  
    filed against Obligor and is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, or  
    if Obligor makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes  
    insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature or any attachment  
    or execution is levied against a substantial portion of the property  
    of Obligor and is not discharged within ninety (90) days, or if any  
    law or court order shall require the City, Custodian or any other  
    party to refund or otherwise relinquish any portion of any amount paid  
    under the Obligor Note or this Agreement as a preference or for any  
    other reason except refund of duplicative payment;  
  
        (h)  Any representation, warranty or disclosure made to City by  
    Obligor, or contained in any information submitted by Obligor to City  
    or to any government agency in connection with the Loan or the  
    Property, proves to be materially false or misleading as of the date  
    when made or reaffirmed, whether or not such representation or  
    disclosure appears in this Agreement.  
  
    (i)  Any default by Obligor of its obligations under the Certificate  
    and Indemnity, giving effect to any applicable notice and cure  
    provisions thereunder;  
  
    (j)  Any default by the Bank of its obligations under the Letter of  
    Credit, giving effect to any applicable notice and cure provisions  
    thereunder.  
  
    So long as the Letter of Credit remains in effect, if any payment or  
    deposit required under the Loan Documents is ten (10) days past due,  
    the City shall have the right, without notice or demand, to draw on  
    the Letter of Credit for the amount of such payment or deposit.

    an Event of Default hereunder shall be made by notice to Obligor  
    pursuant to Section 7.15 of this Agreement and shall be effective as  
    provided therein.  
  
      6.3  Remedies  .  
  
        (a)  Upon declaring an Event of Default, City may, in addition to  
    any other remedies which City may have hereunder or under the Loan  
    Documents or by law, at its option and without prior demand or notice  
    take any or all of the following actions:  
  
          (1)  Immediately terminate any further advances of Loan funds  
    hereunder and revoke any instructions to any third party holding any  
    such funds;  
  
    (2) Declare the Loan immediately due and payable in full;  
  
          (3)  Draw on the Letter of Credit for payment of all or any  
    portion of the Loan;  
  
          (4)  Foreclose under the Deed of Trust, judicially or  
    nonjudicially, subject to the rights of the Bank in accordance with  
    the Deed of Trust;  
  
          (5)  Apply any or all funds in the Reserve Accounts to amounts  
    due under the Loan Documents, whether by reason of acceleration or  
    otherwise, and cause investments in such accounts to be liquidated for  
    such purpose; and  
  
          (6)  Seek judicial appointment of a receiver.  
  
        (b)  All remedies of City provided for herein and in any other  
    Loan Documents are cumulative and shall be in addition to all other  
    rights and remedies provided by law.  The exercise of any right or  
    remedy by City hereunder shall not in any way constitute a cure or  
    waiver of default hereunder or under any other Loan Document or  
    invalidate any act done pursuant to any notice of default, or  
    prejudice City in the exercise of any of its rights hereunder or under  
    any other Loan Documents unless, in the exercise of said rights, City  
    realizes all amounts owed to it under such Loan Documents.  
  
      6.4  No Default Prior to Declaration  .  No default or Event  
    of Default shall exist under this Agreement or the Obligor Note until  
    the same shall have been declared by the City or other party  
    authorized to make such declaration; provided, that failure to  
    declare, or delay in declaring, a default hereunder shall not  
    constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies or excuse any failure by  
    Obligor to strictly comply with its obligations under all of the Loan  
    Documents.  
  
    ARTICLE VII - MISCELLANEOUS  
  
      7.1  No Waiver  .  No waiver of any noncompliance or breach by  
    Obligor hereunder shall be implied from any failure by City to take  
    action on account of such noncompliance or breach, and no express  
    waiver shall affect any breach or noncompliance other than as  
    specified in the waiver.  Any waiver shall be operative only for the  
    time and to the extent therein stated.  Waivers of any covenant, term  
    or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of  
    any subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition.  The  
    consent or approval by City to, or of, any act by Obligor requiring  
    further consent or approval shall not be deemed to waive or render  
    unnecessary the consent or approval to, or of, any subsequent similar  
    act.  
  
      7.2  Successors and Assigns; Delegation to Custodian; Changes in  
    Custodian and Custodial Agreement  .  This Agreement is made and  
    entered into for the sole protection and benefit of City, HUD, and  
    Obligor, their successors and assigns, and no other person or persons  
    shall have any right of action hereunder.  The terms hereof shall  
    inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the parties  
    hereto; provided, however, that the Obligor's interest hereunder  
    cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred without the prior written  
    consent of City.  Obligor acknowledges and agrees that City may assign  
    to HUD or any custodian or trustee for HUD any or all of City's rights  
    under this Agreement and any of the Loan Documents and may direct that  
    any payment or performance be provided directly to HUD or such  
    custodian or trustee, whether or not the Obligor Note or this  
    Agreement have been assigned.  Obligor agrees that City may delegate  
    to the Custodian the right to make demands and give directions on  
    behalf of City under the Loan Documents, but that the scope of any  
    such delegation shall be strictly limited to the terms of a written  
    instrument duly signed on behalf of the City.  Obligor further  
    acknowledges that the Custodial Agreement may be modified or  
    terminated, or a substitute Custodial Agreement executed, or a  
    successor Custodian appointed, in each case without the consent of  
    Obligor so long as the obligations of Obligor are not increased and  
    the rights of the Obligor under the Loan Documents are not adversely  
    affected in any material respect.  Except for minor modifications to  
    the Custodial Agreement not affecting Obligor, City agrees to give  
    reasonable advance notice to the Obligor of any action as described in  
    the preceding sentence, and agrees in each case to provide a copy of  
    any modification or substitute Custodial Agreement to Obligor within  
    fifteen (15) days after the execution thereof.  
  
      7.3  No Defense Based on City Regulatory Actions  .  Obligor  
    understands that (a) the operations of Obligor in the Property and  
    elsewhere are subject to numerous laws, regulations, ordinances and  
    permits, including those of City and other governmental bodies  
    relating to land use, environmental hazards, and other regulatory  
    matters, and (b) the modification, interpretation, application, or  
    revocation of such laws, regulations, rules or permits could adversely  
    affect economic return to Obligor from the Property.  Obligor has  
    conducted its own investigation and relied on the advice of its own  
    counsel and experts as to all such matters in connection with  
    Obligor's acquisition of the Property.  Obligor acknowledges that by  
    entering into this Agreement the City does not make, and that the City  
    expressly disclaims, any representation or assurance whatever as to  
    (1) the present or future status of the Property or the uses thereof  
    under applicable laws or regulations, including those of the City; or  
    (2) the availability, issuance or continuation of any permits,  
    approvals, or interpretations of any kind that may be required or  
    desired by Obligor or any other party in connection with the Property.  
    Obligor agrees that notwithstanding any regulatory action or omission  
    of City affecting Obligor or affecting the use or development of the  
    Property (whether or not such action or omission shall be determined  
    to be consistent with applicable law in any proceeding), no defense,  
    offset or reduction of liability shall be available to Obligor, at law  
    or in equity.  
  
      7.4  Time  .  Time is of the essence of all provisions of the  
    Loan Documents.  
  
      7.5  Entire Agreement; Amendments  .  This Agreement, the  
    other Loan Documents, and the documents, laws and regulations  
    incorporated by reference herein constitute the entire agreement of  
    the parties hereto with respect to the Loan and supersede any prior  
    agreements or understandings, written or oral, with respect to the  
    Loan.  Obligor is not relying upon any promises, representations or  
    understandings, written or oral, in entering into the Loan Documents,  
    other than as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  The  
    obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents are not conditioned  
    upon, and shall not be affected by, any other agreement,  
    understanding, performance or nonperformance by the City or any other  
    party, and in any proceeding to enforce any of Obligor's obligations  
    under the Loan Documents, Obligor shall not be entitled to assert, by  
    way of excuse, offset, counterclaim, grounds for equitable relief, or  
    otherwise, any actual or alleged action or inaction by or on behalf of  
    the City except to the extent that any such action or inaction is  
    expressly required of the City by, and is made a condition of  
    Obligor's obligation by, the Loan Documents.  No amendment,  
    modification, or termination of any provisions of this Agreement or of  
    any of the Loan Documents shall in any event be effective unless the  
    same shall be in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of  
    City and by Obligor, and no such writing shall be construed to modify,  
    waive, or affect the terms of the Loan Documents except to the extent  
    that such document expressly so provides.  
  
      7.6  Headings  .  The article and section headings in no way  
    define, limit, extend or interpret the scope of this Agreement or of  
    any particular article or section.  
  
      7.7  Number and Gender  .  When the context in which the words  
    are used in this Agreement indicate that such is the intent, words in  
    the singular number shall include the plural and vice-versa.  
    References to any one gender shall also include the other gender if  
    applicable under the circumstances.  
  
      7.8  Validity  .  In the event that any provision of this  
    Agreement shall be held to be invalid, the same shall not affect in  
    any respect whatsoever the validity of the remainder of this  
    Agreement.  
  
      7.9  Governing Law  .  This Agreement shall be governed by and  
    construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, and

    DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT  
  
  
  
    The Compass Center, a Lutheran Organization, a Washington nonprofit  
    corporation, operates a facility for the homeless, located on 77 S.  
    Washington Street in the Pioneer Square neighborhood, formerly  
    including an emergency shelter.  Following the 2001 Nisqually  
    earthquake, the Compass Center was damaged beyond the ability to be  
    occupied and remains yellow-tagged, with the upper floors red-tagged  
    and unsuitable for occupancy.  
  
    The Compass Center has proposed to develop a two-parcel site.  First,  
    Compass Center will rehabilitate its current facility on 77 Washington  
    Street.  At the same time, the Compass Center will acquire an adjacent  
    site on 210 Alaska Way for the construction of additional facilities.  
    Upon completion, 77 South Washington will contain 23 permanent rental  
    housing units for persons with household incomes between 30 and 50  
    percent of the median family income, as adjusted for household size.  
    The first floor and basement of 77 South Washington will contain a  
    bank, mail service and hygiene center, all for homeless individuals.  
    On 210 Alaskan Way South, the project will begin with demolition of a  
    4,200 square foot single story warehouse building on a 8,077 square  
    foot parcel.  The building is obsolete, unoccupied and considered an  
    invasive use within the historic district.  After demolition, Compass  
    Center will construct a 78 bed, new transitional housing facility with  
    kitchen, dining room, laundry facilities, community room,  
    administrative offices and parking.  Acquisition, construction and  
    rehabilitation costs of the two-parcel site have been estimated at  
    $14,779,884.  
  
    The Section 108 loan in the principal amount of $1,300,000 will  
    provide the financing for acquisition and related acquisition costs of  
    210 Alaskan Way South.  
  
    Acquisition will be completed in July 2003.  The construction and  
    rehabilitation of both buildings will be completed in June 2005.

    VARIABLE/FIXED RATE PROMISSORY NOTE  
  
    Seattle, Washington                  $1,300,000.00  
  
    _________, 2003  
  
    FOR VALUE RECEIVED, THE COMPASS CENTER, A LUTHERAN ORGANIZATION  
    ("Obligor"), a Washington nonprofit corporation, promises to pay to  
    THE CITY OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON ("Payee"), a Washington municipal  
    corporation, or order, as directed by the City and, at the time or  
    times provided herein, the sum of One Million Three Hundred Thousand  
    and no/100 Dollars ($1,300,000.00), with interest as provided herein.  
  
    This Note is given to evidence a loan (the "Loan") made pursuant to  
    the Loan Agreement dated as of _________, 2003 (as supplemented or  
    amended from time to time, the "Loan Agreement"), between the Obligor  
    and the Payee.  The funds used by the Payee to make the Loan have been  
    obtained by Payee exclusively through the sale of a note or notes in  
    the total principal amount of $15,500,000 issued by the Payee (the  
    "City Note") pursuant to Section 108 of the Housing and Community  
    Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC section5308) and 24 CFR  
    570.700, et seq., pursuant to which the Payee has entered into certain  
    agreements, including, but not limited to, (a) with the United States  
    Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"), a Contract for  
    Loan Guarantee Assistance (which contract incorporates by reference,  
    an Amended and Restated Master Fiscal Agency Agreement between HUD and  
    JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank)), (b)  
    with HUD, the BEDI Grant Agreement #B-99-BD-53-0015, and (c) with  
    JPMorgan Chase Bank, an Indenture of Trust and Custodial Agreement  
    (which documents, as amended or amended from time to time, may be  
    referred to collectively as the "Master Agreement").  The Obligor  
    acknowledges and agrees that the Loan is made subject to all of the  
    terms and conditions of the Master Agreement and the City Note.  Any  
    capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings provided  
    in the City Note, the Loan Agreement or the Master Agreement as  
    applicable.  
  
    Loan advances made from time to time in accordance with the terms of  
    this Note and the Loan Agreement shall bear interest from the date and  
    at the rates applicable to the corresponding Advances made under the  
    City Note until repayment is made in full.  Initially, such interest  
    shall accrue at a variable interest rate on the unpaid principal  
    balance of each advance.  The initial variable interest rate for each  
    advance hereunder will be set on the date of such advance and will be  
    equal to 20 basis points (.20%) above the Applicable LIBO Rate (as  
    hereinafter defined) and thereafter will be adjusted monthly on the  
    first day of each month (each, a "Reset Date") to a variable interest  
    rate equal to 20 basis points (.20%) above the Applicable LIBO Rate  
    (such interest rate, as reset from time to time, the "Standard Note  
    Rate").  If the Conversion Date for the City Note has not occurred by  
    the March 1 following the initial Advance thereunder, then the  
    variable interest rate hereunder will be equal to the variable  
    interest rate on the City Note set pursuant to the terms of Appendix A  
    to the City Note.  If the Fiscal Agent does not receive notice of  
    either a Negotiated Special Interest Rate or Holder Determined Special  
    Interest Rate (as defined in Appendix A to the City Note) from the  
    Secretary or Holder, respectively, by the times specified in Appendix  
    A to the City Note, then the Standard Note Rate shall apply for the  
    period to which such Negotiated Special Interest Rate or Holder  
    Determined Special Interest Rate would otherwise apply.  
  
    "LIBO Rate" for any given Business Day means, except in the case of  
    manifest error, the interest rate per annum published on that day in  
    the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street Journal or any successor  
    publication ("WSJ"), published by Dow Jones & Company, Inc., in the  
    section titled "Money Rates" (or any successor section) and opposite  
    the caption "London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) -- three months"  
    (or any successor caption).  If such rate does not appear in WSJ on a  
    given Business Day, for each interest period, the LIBO Rate shall be  
    the interest rate, converted to a bond-equivalent yield basis, for  
    deposits in U.S. dollars for three months which appears on Telerate  
    Page 3750 or such other page as may replace Page 3750 on that service  
    or such other service or services as may be nominated by the British  
    Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying such rate  
    (together, "Telerate Page 3750") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the  
    day (the "Determination Date") that is two London Banking Days  
    preceding the relevant Reset Date or Advance.  If such rate does not  
    appear on Telerate Page 3750 on such Determination Date, such rate  
    shall be obtained from the Reuters Screen ISDA Page as of 11:00 a.m.,  
    London time, on such Determination Date. If, in turn, such rate does  
    not appear on the Reuters Screen ISDA Page on such Determination Date,  
    the offered quotation from each of four reference banks (expressed as  
    a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time,  
    on such Determination Date for deposits in U.S. dollars to prime banks  
    on the London interbank market for a 3-month period, commencing on the  
    Reset Date or date of such Advance, shall be obtained. If at least two  
    such quotations are provided, the LIBO Rate for such Reset Date or  
    date of such Advance will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations,  
    rounded to five decimal places.  If fewer than two such quotations are  
    provided as requested, the LIBO Rate for that Determination Date shall  
    be the rate for the most recent day preceding such Determination Date  
    for which the LIBO Rate shall have been displayed on Telerate Page  
    3750. The LIBO Rate for any interest period shall be converted to a  
    bond-equivalent yield basis by multiplying such rate by the actual  
    number of days in such interest period and dividing that number by  
    180.  
  
    "Applicable LIBO Rate" means:  (1) with respect to the initial  
    interest rate for the first advance hereunder, the LIBO Rate two  
    London Banking Days before the date of such first advance; (2) with  
    respect to the initial interest rate for any subsequent advance made  
    before the first Reset Date, the interest rate borne by the first  
    advance; (3) with respect to the initial interest rate for any  
    subsequent advance made after the first Reset Date, the LIBO Rate two  
    London Banking Days before the immediately preceding Reset Date; and  
    (4) with respect to the subsequent interest rate at any Reset Date for  
    any advance, the LIBO Rate two London Banking Days before such Reset  
    Date.  
  
    "London Banking Day" means any day in which dealings in deposits in  
    United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.  
    Interest payable on or before the Conversion Date shall be calculated  
    on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days lapsed.  
  
      Prior to the Conversion Date, the aggregate amount of advances under  
    this Note for each specified Principal Due Date under the City Note  
    shall be as set forth on the attached Exhibit 1, except to the extent  
    such principal amount shall have been reduced by prepayment before  
    such Principal Due Date as provided herein.  
  
    On the Conversion Date (whether conversion to a fixed rate or rates is  
    effected with the consent of the Obligor or otherwise), all advances  
    owed by the Obligor under this Note with the same Principal Due Date  
    shall be aggregated into a single principal amount, which will accrue  
    interest at the fixed rate that the underwriters of the City Note  
    determine will enable them to sell the City Note under then prevailing  
    market conditions as of the Conversion Date at one hundred percent  
    (100%) of the aggregate amount thereof Conversion to a fixed rate is  
    subject to limitations set forth in the Loan Agreement.  
  
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence of any  
    default hereunder or under the Loan Agreement, which default is not  
    cured as permitted by the Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal  
    balance of the Loan and this Note shall bear interest at the greater  
    of the rate set as provided above or twelve percent (12%) per annum.  
  
      Interest payable on or before the Conversion Date shall be  
    calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of  
    days elapsed.  Interest after the Conversion Date shall be calculated  
    on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.  
  
    The principal of and interest on this Note shall be due and payable at  
    the same time correlative principal of and interest on the City Note  
    is due and payable.  Such interest is due and payable quarterly in  
    arrears, and such principal is due as set out on Exhibit 1 attached  
    hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.  Payments of  
    principal of and interest on this Note shall be made to the Loan  
    Repayment Account.  
  
    In order to ensure timely payment of such principal and interest,  
    commencing in the first month disbursement of principal of the City  
    Note in respect of this Note is to be made, Obligor shall make monthly  
    installment payments to the Custodian for deposit in an account  
    maintained by the Custodian for the accumulation of funds for payments  
    on this Note (the "Loan Repayment Account," established under the  
    Custodial Agreement and Letter Agreements.  Each reference herein to  
    such account and any other account under the Custodial Agreement,  
    shall mean, unless the context otherwise clearly requires, a  
    subaccount of that account maintained with respect to this Note).  
    Each such monthly payment shall be due and payable, in immediately  
    available funds, on the "Deposit Day," which shall be the fifteenth  
    (15th) day of the month, or if such day is not a Business Day, then on  
    the previous Business Day; provided that the Deposit Day in respect of  
    any Conversion Date shall be the day which is two Business Days prior  
    to the Conversion Date.  Subject to the provisions of the next  
    paragraph, each such payment shall be in an amount equal to the actual  
    interest accruing on this Note during the corresponding month (the  
    "Interest Component"), at the rate or blended rate, as the case may  
    be, then in effect, plus one-twelfth (1/12th) of the total principal  
    coming due on this Note on the next scheduled principal payment date  
    ("Principal Component"); provided, that the monthly payment obligation  
    in respect of the Interest Component shall be adjusted ratably during  
    any month the Loan is not outstanding for the entire month; and  
    provided further, that the Principal Component shall be adjusted  
    ratably during any period that fewer than twelve (12) Deposit Days are  
    scheduled to occur prior to the corresponding Obligor Note Payment  
    Date (as such term is defined in the next paragraph of this Note) in  
    respect of a principal payment on this Note.  Except as provided in  
    the next paragraph, Obligor shall not be entitled to any reductions  
    in, or credits against, deposits required to be made to the Loan  
    Repayment Account based upon interest or earnings credited to the Loan  
    Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account or the BEDI  
    Grant Reserve Account.  The Custodian is hereby irrevocably authorized  
    to transfer funds from the Loan Repayment Investment Account to the  
    Loan Repayment Account on each Obligor Note Payment Date, in the full  
    amount due on this Note on each such date, and from the BEDI Grant  
    Reserve Account, the amounts described in the next paragraph.  
    Obligor's monthly installment payments into the Loan Repayment Account  
    shall not constitute payments under this Note.  Obligor shall be  
    credited with the payment of interest on and the principal of this  
    Note only when and solely to the extent that funds on deposit in or  
    transferred to the Loan Repayment Account in accordance with the terms  
    of the Loan Agreement are applied to the payment of the allocable  
    portion of the City Note.  The Custodian is further irrevocably  
    authorized by Obligor to liquidate investments in the Loan Repayment  
    Investment Account and the BEDI Grant Reserve Account, in the  
    Custodian's discretion, and without liability for any loss on any such  
    liquidation, for the purposes described in this paragraph.  
  
    Obligor and Payee intend, notwithstanding the actual rate of interest  
    payable on the Loan and Obligor Note from time to time, that to the  
    extent feasible, Obligor's Interest Component payment obligations  
    shall be based upon a deemed rate of interest equal to four percent  
    (4.0%) per annum.  If the rate or blended rate, as the case may be, of  
    interest applicable to this Note during any month is less than four  
    percent (4.0%) per annum, Obligor shall pay to the Custodian on the  
    corresponding Deposit Day, for deposit into the Loan Repayment  
    Account, as the Interest Component, an amount equal to the Interest  
    Component payment that would have been due under the preceding  
    paragraph of this Note on such date had the rate during such period  
    been four percent (4.0%) per annum, notwithstanding that the actual  
    interest accruing on this Note during such period may be less.  If the  
    rate or blended rate as the case may be, of interest applicable to  
    this Note during any month exceeds four percent (4.0%) per annum,  
    unless the Custodian shall have delivered to Obligor a Shortfall  
    Notice (defined in this paragraph, below), Obligor shall pay to the  
    Custodian on the corresponding Deposit Day, an Interest Component  
    payment based on a rate equal to four percent (4.0%) per annum on the  
    then-outstanding principal balance of this Note, and the Custodian  
    shall look to other funds on deposit in the Loan Repayment Account,  
    the Loan Repayment Investment Account and the BEDI Grant Reserve  
    Account to pay the balance of interest scheduled to become due on this  
    Note on the next payment date (each an "Obligor Note Payment Date");  
    provided, that Custodian shall exhaust funds on deposit in the Loan  
    Repayment Account and Loan Repayment Investment Account from time to  
    time prior to making any withdrawals from the BEDI Grant Reserve  
    Account to pay any part of the Interest Component of any monthly  
    deposit; and provided further, that the Custodian is not authorized to  
    and shall not withdraw from the BEDI Grant Reserve Account for such  
    purposes, an aggregate amount greater than One Hundred Forty-Six  
    Thousand Seven Hundred Seventy-Four and no/100 Dollars ($146,774.00)  
    plus investment earnings thereon, if any.  If not less than five (5)  
    Business Days prior to any Deposit Day the Custodian determines that  
    there shall or may be insufficient funds available in the Loan  
    Repayment Account, the Loan Repayment Investment Account and the BEDI  
    Grant Reserve Account to pay the full amount of principal and interest  
    to become due on this Note on the next date Obligor Note Payment Date,  
    taking into account the expected payment of interest at a deemed rate  
    of four percent (4.0%) per annum required to be made by Obligor on  
    such Deposit Day and on each subsequent Deposit Day scheduled to occur  
    prior to such Obligor Note Payment Date, the Custodian shall promptly  
    deliver written notice (each, a "Shortfall Notice") to that effect to  
    the Obligor (with a copy to City).  Upon receipt of any such Shortfall  
    Notice, and in any event, on or before the corresponding Deposit Day,  
    the Obligor shall pay to the Custodian, for deposit into the Loan  
    Repayment Account, the full amount of interest actually accruing on  
    this Note during the corresponding month.  Obligor acknowledges and  
    agrees that interest stabilization payments made by Obligor in  
    accordance with this paragraph and deposited in the Loan Repayment  
    Account, together with the earnings thereon, if any, shall be held,  
    without right of withdrawal or reimbursement.  
  
      If any deposit required to be made into the Loan Repayment Account  
    is not received within ten (10) days after the date when such deposit  
    is due, in addition to additional interest required to be paid in  
    accordance with this Note, Obligor agrees to pay a late charge equal  
    to five percent (5.0%) of the amount past due, as compensation to  
    Payee for the staff time and resources required to handle such  
    delinquencies, and not as a penalty.  Such late charges shall not be  
    credited to the Loan Repayment Account, but shall be retained by  
    Payee.  Late charges under this Section are in addition to, and not in  
    substitution for, the other remedies provided in the Loan Documents.  
  
    Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, all principal,  
    interest, fees, costs and other charges that Obligor is obligated to  
    pay in connection with this Note and the Loan shall be due and  
    payable, in full, on ___________.  
  
    This Note is secured by a Letter of Credit of even date, executed and  
    delivered by KeyBank National Association (the "Bank"), in the initial  
    stated amount of One Million Three Hundred Thousand and no/100 Dollars  
    ($1,300,000).  The Letter of Credit is scheduled to expire on the  
    earlier of the date of completion of the Project (defined in the Loan  
    Agreement) or ________, 2005, subject to extension in accordance with  
    the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement of even date herewith between  
    Obligor and the Bank (the "Reimbursement Agreement").  
  
    This Note, together with other obligations of Obligor under the Loan  
    Documents (but not the Certificate and Indemnity), and Obligor's  
    obligations to the Bank under the Reimbursement Agreement are secured,  
    pari passu, by a Deed of Trust, Assignment of Leases and Rents, and  
    Security Agreement with Fixture Filing (as supplemented or amended  
    from time to time, the "Deed of Trust"), of even date herewith, from  
    the Obligor to the Payee and the Bank.  Finally, this Note, together  
    with other obligations of Obligor under the Loan Documents (including  
    obligations under the Certificate and Indemnity) are secured by  
    security interests in the monies and investments held in certain  
    Reserves established in accordance with the Loan Agreement and Master  
    Agreement, and by an assignment of leases and rents, which security  
    interests are perfected, to the extent allowable under Washington law,  
    by recording in the records of King County, Washington and filing of  
    financing statements with the Washington State Department of  
    Licensing.  
  
    The principal hereof and any interest accrued hereon may be prepaid,  
    provided, however, that any prepayment shall not reduce the principal  
    payment required at any subsequent time until this Note is paid in  
    full, together with interest hereon, and provided, further:  
  
    (a)  On or before the Conversion Date, this Note may be prepaid in  
    whole or in part upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the  
    Payee and with, and only with, the consent of HUD.  Any prepayment of  
    the principal hereof shall be accompanied by all accrued interest  
    thereon to the date of prepayment, and partial prepayments shall be  
    credited against the principal amount last becoming due hereunder.  
  
    (b)  After the Conversion Date, this Note may be prepaid in whole or  
    in part at any time provided Obligor shall give 90 days prior written  
    notice of its intention to make any prepayment.  Any prepayment shall  
    be applied to the payments last becoming due under this Note.  No  
    partial prepayment shall relieve the Obligor of the obligation to make  
    any future payments due after the date of any prepayment.  Any  
    prepayment shall be in an amount not less than the amount which is  
    sufficient to defease the portion of the City Note allocable to this  
    Note or the portion hereof to be prepaid as provided in the Master  
    Agreement, including the requirement that principal amounts under the  
    City Note having the latest maturity must be defeased before those  
    with shorter maturities.  If in the event of any prepayment, the Payee  
    incurs any costs, expenses, fees, charges, premiums or losses, the  
    Obligor shall pay such items upon demand in addition to the principal  
    and interest due hereunder.  
  
    Any prepayment by Obligor or any third party, or recovery from the  
    disposition of any collateral, after default shall constitute a  
    prepayment and be subject to all terms and conditions regarding  
    prepayment.  
  
    In the event of any default by Obligor in any term or condition of  
    this Note, the Loan Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Certificate and  
    Indemnity, or any other document executed in connection herewith, or  
    in the event of any default by Bank under the Letter of Credit,  which  
    default is not cured as permitted by the applicable document, the  
    entire principal and accrued interest hereunder shall become  
    immediately due and payable without notice or demand at the option of  
    the Payee.  
  
    If Obligor is in default under the provisions of this Note, the Loan  
    Agreement, the Deed of Trust, the Certificate and Indemnity, or any  
    other document executed in connection herewith, or in the event of any  
    default by Bank under the Letter of Credit, and Payee commences any  
    action to enforce collection hereof or foreclosure under any security  
    document given in connection herewith or therewith, the Obligor agrees  
    to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Payee, including but not  
    limited to Payee's reasonable attorneys' fees.  
  
    Demand, protest, and notice of demand and protest are hereby waived,  
    and the Obligor, to the extent authorized by law hereby waives any and  
    all homestead or other exemption rights which otherwise might apply to  
    the obligation evidenced by this Note, and/or any property covered by  
    any security document given in connection herewith.  
  
    The Obligor executes this Note as a principal and not as a surety.  
  
      ORAL AGREEMENTS, OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LEND MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT,

    EXHIBIT C TO ORDINANCE  
  
    Project Description  
  
    The Compass Center, a Lutheran Organization, a Washington nonprofit  
    corporation, operates a facility for the homeless, located on 77 S.  
    Washington Street in the Pioneer Square neighborhood, formerly  
    including an emergency shelter.  Following the 2001 Nisqually  
    earthquake, the Compass Center building was damaged beyond the ability  
    to be occupied and remains yellow-tagged, with the upper floors red-  
    tagged and unsuitable for occupancy.  
  
    The Compass Center has proposed to develop a two-parcel site.  First,  
    Compass Center will rehabilitate its current facility on 77 Washington  
    Street.  At the same time, the Compass Center will acquire an adjacent  
    site on 210 Alaska Way for the construction of additional facilities.  
    Upon completion, 77 South Washington will contain 23 permanent rental  
    housing units for persons with household incomes between 30 and 50  
    percent of the median family income, as adjusted for household size.  
    The first floor and basement of 77 South Washington will contain a  
    bank, mail service and hygiene center, all for homeless individuals.  
    On 210 Alaskan Way South, the project will begin with demolition of a  
    4,200 square foot single story warehouse building on an 8,077 square  
    foot parcel.  The building is obsolete, unoccupied and considered an  
    invasive use within the historic district.  After demolition, Compass  
    Center will construct a 78 bed, new transitional housing facility with  
    kitchen, dining room, laundry facilities, community room,  
    administrative offices and parking.  Acquisition, construction and  
    rehabilitation costs of the two-parcel site have been estimated at  
    $14,779,884.  
  
    The Section 108 loan in the principal amount of $1,300,000 will  
    provide the financing for acquisition and related acquisition costs of  
    210 Alaskan Way South.  
  
    Loan terms generally will be as follows (exact terms will be in the  
    definitive loan documents):  The loan initially will be made on a  
    floating rate, which will be converted to a fixed rate for each  
    maturity when the City Note is included in a public offering arranged  
    by HUD ("Conversion Date").  Prior to the Conversion Date (if any)  
    under the HUD Contract, interest on the loan will be the greater of 4%  
    per annum or the applicable floating rate under the City Note,  
    currently expected to be 20 basis points above the London Interbank  
    Offered Rate (LIBOR) -- three months ("LIBO Rate") as adjusted  
    monthly.  From and after the Conversion Date, the rates applicable to  
    each installment of principal owed by the Compass Center shall bear  
    interest at the same rate as the installment of principal on the City  
    Note that is due in the same year but with a 4% floor on the blended  
    rate.   Nonetheless, the City will attempt to provide for an effective  
    interest rate to the Compass Center of 4% to the extent possible.  To  
    the extent that the initial floating rate, or the blended rate on all  
    installments after the Conversion Date, rises above the target rate of  
    4%, BEDI Grant Funds will be applied, in the cumulative amount of up  
    to $146,774 (and any earnings thereon), as a grant to the Compass  
    Center in each payment period to stabilize the rate of interest  
    actually paid by Compass Center at the target rate.  In addition, if  
    the Compass Center shall pay any interest at a rate higher than paid  
    by on the City Note during the same period (i.e., the City Note rate  
    was less than 4%), the difference shall be accumulated for use in the  
    same manner as the BEDI funds.  
  
    Obligor will make principal payments on the loan according to the  
    following schedule:

          Total:  $1,300,000  
  
      Security for the loan will be from two sources.  The City will take  
    a first position lien on 210 Alaskan Way South.  Also, from the date  
    of loan closing through the period of construction for 210 Alaskan Way  
    South, the City will hold an irrevocable letter of credit from a  
    commercial bank, initially covering all principal, and subject to  
    reduction according to the Loan Agreement.  Following the completion  
    of construction, the letter of credit will expire, and the City's  
    first position lien will remain.  
  
    Acquisition will be completed in July 2003.  The construction and  
    rehabilitation of both buildings will be completed in June 2005.
