    AN ORDINANCE relating to additional regular property taxes for  
    firefighting, life-safety and other emergency responses; providing for  
    the submission to the voters of the City, at an election to be held  
    therein on November 4, 2003, in conjunction with the state general  
    election to be held on the same date, of a proposition authorizing the  
    City to levy additional regular property taxes in excess of the  
    limitation on levies in Chapter 84.55 RCW for the purpose of paying  
    all or a part of the cost of neighborhood stations, support  
    facilities, marine apparatus, emergency preparedness improvements and  
    other emergency response facilities; providing for interim financing  
    pending tax receipts; and creating a levy oversight committee.  
  
    WHEREAS, the City of Seattle, Washington (the "City"), owns many  
    critical facilities that house fire engine companies, ladder  
    companies, and emergency medical services and other specialty units to  
    mitigate loss of life and property resulting from fires, medical  
    emergencies, and other disasters; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City operates 33 fire stations, built between 1928 and  
    1977; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City generally maintains fire and other emergency  
    facilities in satisfactory operating condition, but has not  
    significantly upgraded, expanded, or modernized those facilities since  
    the voter-approved 1-2-3 Bond program of 1984; and  
  
    WHEREAS, fire and other emergency service delivery has evolved over  
    the last 20 years in response to national professional standards,  
    legal mandates, and newly recognized risks from terrorism and  
    hazardous materials; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Loma Prieta earthquake in California on October 17, 1989,  
    the Northridge earthquake in California on January 17, 1994, the Kobe  
    earthquake in Japan on January 15, 1995, and the Nisqually Earthquake  
    in Seattle on February 28, 2001 highlighted the potential for seismic  
    damage in Seattle and the need for the City to continue to prepare for  
    future earthquakes and to reevaluate the structural conditions of  
    essential public safety facilities; and  
  
    WHEREAS, since 1996 various studies identified significant seismic  
    vulnerabilities at 32 of the City's 33 fire stations, culminating in a  
    study completed in 2003 that produced a range of options for fire  
    facility improvements; and  
  
    WHEREAS, marina fires in 2001 and 2002 highlighted the shortcomings of  
    the City's current firefighting capacity and response times on both  
    fresh and salt water; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the fire boat Chief Seattle, in operation since 1986,  
    requires significant renovation work to remain in service for the next  
    25 years and the fire boat Alki, in operation since 1928, is of  
    advanced age and limited firefighting capacity; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City's existing emergency operations center, which is  
    critical to the coordination of emergency services in response to  
    natural and manmade disasters, is housed in a facility that is  
    seismically vulnerable, too small for modern operations, and exposed  
    to various natural and manmade hazards; and  
  
    WHEREAS, staff from the Fleets and Facilities Department, Seattle Fire  
    Department and Department of Finance, under the direction of a client  
    group that included department heads from those departments and  
    representatives from the Mayor's office and City Council, developed  
    detailed programming and feasibility analyses for fire operations and  
    facilities requirements; and  
  
    WHEREAS, in Resolution 30121 the City stated its policy that new City  
    construction and major remodels over 5,000 gross square feet of  
    occupied space be sustainable, and established the U.S. Green Building  
    Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver  
    rating as the minimum standard for sustainability; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Mayor and City Council wish to propose to voters that a  
    comprehensive program of improvements to firefighting, life-safety,  
    and other emergency response facilities be funded through the levy of  
    additional regular property taxes as set forth in this ordinance; NOW,  
    THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1.  Definitions.  As used in this ordinance, the following  
    words shall have the following meanings:  
  
    "Levy Plan" means designing, constructing, acquiring, improving,  
    renovating, and equipping capital improvement projects that show  
    entries for "Levy Proceeds Allocations" in Attachment A, with any  
    modifications and additions that may be authorized as permitted by  
    this ordinance, for providing firefighting, life-safety, and other  
    emergency response services designed to address seismic  
    vulnerabilities, replace aging assets, and respond to new national  
    professional standards, legal mandates, and newly recognized risks  
    from terrorism and hazardous materials.  In addition to the Levy Plan,  
    if the voters approve the funding proposition submitted to them  
    pursuant to this ordinance, the City intends to use other existing or  
    projected revenue sources to pay for the projects that show entries  
    only for "Other City Funding Sources" in Attachment A.  Some or all of  
    these additional projects may be eliminated if expected revenues are  
    not available.  
  
    "Levy Proceeds" means the additional taxes collected pursuant to the  
    authority granted by the voters under this ordinance and, if the City  
    issues bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness payable wholly  
    or in part from the additional taxes authorized under this ordinance,  
    as permitted by Section 6 of this ordinance, then Levy Proceeds also  
    includes the proceeds of those bonds, notes, or other evidences of  
    indebtedness.  
  
    "Neighborhood Stations" includes structures that are designed to house  
    or moor one or more firefighting or emergency services vehicles,  
    vessels, or other apparatus, and which may include facilities in or  
    associated with those structures to accommodate the needs of  
    firefighters and other emergency services personnel.  
  
    "Support Facilities" includes facilities to house operations,  
    training, and other administrative and regulatory functions such as  
    but not limited to monitoring fire alarms and fire code compliance and  
    investigating fires, and also includes costs of issuing bonds, notes,  
    or other evidences of indebtedness.  
  
    "Emergency Preparedness" includes improvements designed to reduce or  
    mitigate vulnerabilities to disasters or to facilitate emergency  
    responses such as but not limited to hardening hydrants and other  
    facilities for supplying water for firefighting, improving power  
    supplies to emergency shelters, establishing a new emergency  
    operations center, and creating and equipping caches of emergency  
    supplies.  
  
    "Marine" includes acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of one  
    or more fireboats or other vessels for firefighting or other emergency  
    response.  
  
    Section 2.  Levy of Additional Regular Property Taxes - Submittal.  
  
    The City hereby submits to the qualified electors of the City a  
    proposition as authorized by RCW 84.55.050 to exceed the levy  
    limitation on regular property taxes contained in RCW 84.55.010 for  
    property taxes levied in 2003 through 2011 for collection in 2004  
    through 2012, respectively, for the sole purpose of raising up to  
    $167,200,000 in aggregate over a period of up to nine (9) years for  
    firefighting, life-safety and other emergency response facilities.  
    The proposition shall be limited so that the City shall not levy more  
    than Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) in the first year, in  
    addition to the maximum amount of regular property taxes it could have  
    levied consistent with Chapter 84.55 RCW in the absence of this  
    ordinance.  Pursuant to RCW 84.55.050(4), the maximum regular property  
    taxes that may be levied in 2012 for collection in 2013 and in later  
    years shall be computed as if the limit on regular property taxes had  
    not been increased under this ordinance.  
  
    Section 3.  Use of Levy Proceeds.  
  
      A.  The Levy Proceeds shall be allocated to the following four  
    categories: Neighborhood Stations, Support Facilities, Emergency  
    Preparedness, and Marine.  Total funding from Levy Proceeds for each  
    category shall not exceed the respective amounts identified in the  
    following table unless the City in an ordinance passed by a two-thirds  
    (2/3) vote of the City Council determines to change the allocation of  
    Levy Proceeds after the Council or a committee holds a public hearing  
    and after the Council considers any recommendation that may have been  
    made by the Mayor or by the oversight committee established in Section  
    7:  
  
    Categories                         Anticipated Allocation of Levy Proceeds  
    Neighborhood Stations              $106,620,000  
    Support Facilities                  $30,258,000  
    Emergency Preparedness              $18,698,000  
    Marine                              $11,624,000  
    Total                              $167,200,000  
  
      B.  Specific projects on which Levy Proceeds may be spent within  
    each of the categories, with the estimated amount of Levy Proceeds to  
    be devoted to each project, are shown in the "Levy Proceeds  
    Allocations" column in Attachment A.  Total expenditure of Levy  
    Proceeds on each project shall not exceed the amount of Levy Proceeds  
    shown for that project in Attachment A by more than ten percent unless  
    the City Council approves the additional expenditure by ordinance  
    after the Council or a committee holds a public hearing.  
  
      C.  Each year by the end of August, the Fleets and Facilities  
    Department or its functional successor (the "Department") shall submit  
    to the City Council a report on spending to date of the Levy Proceeds  
    and any interest earnings thereon, and a proposed spending plan  
    allocating expected Levy Proceeds and any interest earnings among the  
    categories and projects for the upcoming budget year, the remaining  
    years in which additional taxes may be collected under this ordinance,  
    and any additional years in which the Department plans to spend Levy  
    Proceeds.  
  
      D.  The City will design and build the following so they are  
    reasonably anticipated to meet at least the current LEED Silver  
    rating, subject to the appropriation of sufficient funds to accomplish  
    that rating while reasonably meeting other design objectives for each  
    facility:  
  
        (i) All of the projects in the Neighborhood Stations category that  
    include rebuilding or fully remodeling stations (these are presently  
    anticipated to be Stations 2, 6, 9, 10, 14, 17, 20, 21, 22, 28, 30,  
    32, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41);  
  
        (ii) The projects in the Support Facilities category; and  
  
        (iii) The Emergency Operations Center project in the Emergency  
    Preparedness category.  
  
    Section 4.  Alterations and Additions to Levy Plan.  
  
      A.  Projects to be funded to any extent from Levy Proceeds that are  
    available for any reason may be added to a category only if the City  
    by an ordinance passed by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the City Council  
    so authorizes after the Council or a committee holds a public hearing  
    and after the Council considers any recommendation that may have been  
    made by the Mayor or by the oversight committee established in Section  
    7.  
  
      B.  The City intends to complete all projects shown in Attachment A  
    using Levy Proceeds and other funds that may become available.  If,  
    however, the City determines in an ordinance passed by a two-thirds  
    (2/3) vote of the City Council, after the Council or a committee holds  
    a public hearing and after the Council considers any recommendation  
    that may have been made by the Mayor or by the oversight committee  
    established in Section 7, that it is impractical or no longer  
    desirable to complete a project, that project may be deleted.  
  
      C.  The City may seek supplemental, matching or additional funds  
    from other sources to pay all or part of the cost of a project and, if  
    successful, may apply such funds, in lieu of or in addition to Levy  
    Proceeds, to accomplishment thereof or to complement or enlarge a  
    project or to reduce the amount of additional taxes levied under the  
    authority of this ordinance.  
  
    Section 5.  Deposit of Levy Proceeds.  The proceeds of additional  
    taxes authorized under this ordinance and the proceeds of any bonds,  
    notes, or other evidences of indebtedness issued as permitted by  
    Section 6 of this ordinance shall each be deposited into a separate  
    subfund or other accounting unit in the City Treasury referred to, in  
    the case of the tax proceeds, as the 2003 Fire Facilities Fund (the  
    "Fund") or such other designation as the Director of Executive  
    Administration shall determine.  Money in the Fund may be temporarily  
    deposited or invested in such manner as may be lawful for the  
    investment of City money, and interest and other earnings shall be  
    deposited in the Fund.  The Levy Proceeds shall be applied solely to  
    carry out the Levy Plan but if the City issues bonds, notes, or other  
    evidences of indebtedness as permitted by Section 6 of this ordinance,  
    the additional taxes authorized under this ordinance may be used to  
    pay debt service and costs of that debt as permitted in Section 6.  
    The Director of Executive Administration is authorized to create other  
    subfunds or accounts as may be needed to implement the purposes of  
    this ordinance.  
  
    Section 6.  Bond and Notes. To the extent permitted by applicable law  
    the City may issue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness  
    payable wholly or in part from the additional taxes authorized under  
    this ordinance, and may pledge and may apply such taxes to the payment  
    of principal of, interest on, and premium (if any) on such bonds,  
    notes, or other evidences of indebtedness and to the payment of costs  
    associated with them.  
  
    Section 7.  Oversight Committee.  
  
      A.  If the voters of the City approve the proposition submitted to  
    them pursuant to this ordinance, the Fire Facilities Oversight  
    Committee ("FFOC") is hereby established.  The FFOC shall have the  
    authority to provide policy direction and technical advice on  
    implementation of particular projects, including but not limited to  
    issues such as construction staging, design, site selection, and  
    contracting approaches; to review the expenditure of Levy Proceeds;  
    and to advise upon expenditures and allocations of Levy Proceeds.  
    Input from the FFOC is not a condition precedent to City action on any  
    Levy Plan matter.  The City Council shall not be bound by the  
    recommendations or advice of the FFOC or its members.  The FFOC will  
    meet quarterly with the Fleets and Facilities Director or his or her  
    designee, beginning in the calendar quarter following the successful  
    passage of the ballot measure submitted to the voters pursuant to this  
    ordinance, unless that schedule is changed by a majority of the FFOC.  
  
      B.  The FFOC shall consist of six (6) members.  One shall be a  
    "Seattle resident" with financial or relevant technical expertise who  
    shall be selected by the City Council; two shall be members of the  
    City Council selected by the City Council; two shall be City employees  
    selected by the Mayor; and one shall be selected by and from the  
    uniformed Seattle fire fighters below the rank of Battalion Chief  
    ("eligible fire fighters").  If the eligible fire fighters have not  
    selected an eligible fire fighter to serve on the FFOC by February 1,  
    2004, then the City Council president shall select this member from  
    among eligible fire fighters.  Members shall be selected for the  
    duration of the Levy Plan.  The "Seattle resident" member shall be  
    subject to removal by the City Council for being absent without good  
    cause from two (2) consecutive meetings or for moving his or her  
    residence from Seattle, or for other cause.  Others shall cease to be  
    members if they no longer belong to the group from which selected.  
    Vacancies shall be filled by the original selecting authority,  
    provided that if a vacancy for the member who is an eligible fire  
    fighter is not filled within 60 days, then the City Council president  
    shall fill the vacancy from among eligible fire fighters.  Members  
    shall serve without pay but, at the option of the Director of Fleets  
    and Facilities, the "Seattle resident" member may be reimbursed his or  
    her expenses from Levy Proceeds, including payments for child care  
    while attending meetings.  The FFOC may adopt rules for its own  
    procedures, including quorum requirements and the frequency of  
    meetings.  Meetings of the FFOC will be open to the public unless, had  
    the FFOC been subject to chapter 42.30 RCW, that law would not have  
    required that the meeting or portion of the meeting be open to the  
    public.  
  
    Section 8.  Election - Ballot Title.  The City Council finds that an  
    emergency exists that requires proposing the Levy Plan and requests  
    that the Director of Records and Elections of King County, Washington,  
    as ex officio Supervisor of Elections, find the existence of an  
    emergency pursuant to RCW 29.13.020 and call and conduct a special  
    election in the City in conjunction with the state general election to  
    be held on November 4, 2003, for the purpose of submitting to the  
    qualified electors of the City the proposition set forth below.  The  
    City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to certify the  
    proposition to the King County Director of Records and Elections in  
    the following form:
