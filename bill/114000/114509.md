    ORDINANCE __________  
  
    AN ORDINANCE increasing the appropriation in the 2003 budget of the  
    Department of Public Health - Seattle & King County by decreasing the  
    appropriation in the Reserve for Community Health Center Partners in  
    the 2003 Finance General budget.  
  
    WHEREAS in the 2003 budget the City Council appropriated $2,541,505  
    for the program in Community Health Center Partners in the Department  
    of Public Health - Seattle & King County ("Public Health"), and  
    appropriated $2,541,504 for the Department of Finance General as a  
    reserve for Community Health Center Partners; and  
  
    WHEREAS in making these appropriations the City Council's intent was  
    to fund community health centers in the first half of 2003, but  
    reserve funding for the second half of 2003 pending a review of the  
    performance of and funding sources for similar services provided by  
    community health centers and Public Health and pending the Council's  
    evaluation of the results of this review; and  
  
    WHEREAS preliminary results from this review indicate that reducing  
    City funding for community health centers is likely to significantly  
    reduce community health services; and  
  
    WHEREAS preliminary results from this review also indicate that the  
    current allocation of City funding to community health centers is not  
    based on an analysis of current community health needs; and  
  
    WHEREAS the City Council wishes to provide funding for Public Health's  
    Community Health Center Partners program for the remainder of 2003;  
    and  
  
    WHEREAS the City Council believes future allocations of City funds to  
    community health centers should be based on an analysis of community  
    health needs, and intends to review the allocation of funding among  
    community health centers in 2004 in this light; and  
  
    WHEREAS Ordinance 121068 transferred $15,000 from the Finance General  
    Reserve for Community Health Center Partners to the Finance Department  
    to fund consultant assistance in the review described above, and the  
    City Council wishes to reserve an additional $15,000 for possible  
    consultant assistance in developing an improved method for allocating  
    funding among community health centers; NOW THEREFORE  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:
