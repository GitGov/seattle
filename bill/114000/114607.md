    II.  
  
      1.  Effective July 2, 2003, the Department shall implement a Night  
    Duty Commander pilot program.  The Night Duty Commander program and  
    Night Duty Commander pay will expire at the end of the day on  
    December 31, 2003, unless the parties agree prior to January 1, 2004  
    to extend that program.  In the event the pilot program expires, the  
    applicable salary schedule for captain shall thereafter be as  
    provided in paragraph I.3 above until that salary schedule is  
    modified by agreement of the parties or an arbitration award.  During  
    the pilot period, the designated captain serving as the Night Duty  
    Commander shall report to the Deputy Chief of Operations or the  
    Deputy Chief of Operation's designee.  The role of the Night Duty  
    Commander shall be to provide guidance and oversight during critical  
    situations and he/she shall represent the Deputy Chief of Operations  
    and the Chief of Police while on such duty.  All captains shall serve  
    in the capacity of Night Duty Commander on a rotating basis.  Service  
    as Night Duty Commander shall be subject to the following:  
  
        a.  The Deputy Chief of Operations or designee shall be  
    responsible for scheduling the Night Duty Commander shift rotations,  
    and for approval of shift trades of Night Duty Commander duties  
    between captains.  It is the intention of the parties to this  
    Memorandum of Understanding that the rotational Night Duty Commander  
    assignments shall be shared as equally as possible among all  
    captains.  
  
    b.  The duty of the Night Duty Commander shall be from 0800  
    hours Wednesday to 0800 hours the following Wednesday.  The regular  
    work shift of a Night Duty Commander shall be Wednesday through  
    Saturday, from 1830 hours to 0430 hours.  During the week that a  
    captain is assigned Night Duty Commander responsibility, Sunday,  
    Monday and Tuesday will normally be considered his/her furlough days.  
    The captain then serving as Night Duty Commander will be subject to  
    call out as per past practice, if his/her presence is reasonably  
    deemed necessary by the Deputy Chief of Operations or his/her  
    designee.  Departmental needs (limited to demonstrations, other  
    unusual occurrences or critical situations) and schedule conflicts  
    due to illness, injury or other events may require adjustment of work  
    shifts, furlough days, or the personnel assigned as Night Duty  
    Commander.  Any such adjustments shall be decided by the Deputy Chief  
    of Operations or his/her designee, based upon good and reasonable  
    cause, following consultation with the individual(s) affected by such  
    change(s).  It is agreed and understood that normally only one  
    captain will be serving as Night Duty Commander at any one time.  
  
        c.  During the week a captain serves as the Night Duty Commander,  
    the captain so assigned shall not be expected or required to attend  
    daytime meetings or to perform other daytime functions.  Although the  
    captain assigned Night Duty Commander duty is not normally exercising  
    authority within his/her individual permanent assignment while  
    assigned his/her week of Night Duty Commander duties, the captain  
    retains responsibility for that permanent assignment and he/she is  
    not precluded from attending to or dealing with any issues involving  
    that permanent assignment, per that captain's professional judgment  
    and individual discretion.  
  
        d.  Every twenty-four (24) months after initially implementing  
    the Night Duty Commander rotation, a review shall be jointly  
    conducted by the City and the Association to determine whether any  
    captain has performed the Night Duty Commander assignment more or  
    less than the number of weeks he/she was scheduled or should have  
    been scheduled to do so in the normal course of events.  Captains  
    will be considered to have fulfilled their Night Duty Commander  
    responsibilities if they serve their duty days for the major portion  
    of any duty week, or if their absence was due to circumstances beyond  
    their control (e.g., PORT response, serious family emergency).  Those  
    captains who, per the review, have served in such capacity less than  
    an appropriate number of weeks for any reason other than decisions  
    made in the good faith, reasonable judgment of the Deputy Chief of  
    Operations or his/her designee,  shall have sixty (60) days (or such  
    longer time as the Association and the City mutually agree in  
    writing) from the date they are notified of such deficiency, in order  
    to perform the number of Night Duty Commander assignments necessary  
    to have served an appropriate number of Night Duty Commander  
    assignments over the relevant time period.  Failure to have served an  
    appropriate number of Night Duty Commander assignments by the end of  
    the 60 days (or mutually extended time) may result in appropriate  
    corrective action.  In the event an employee is newly promoted to  
    captain after this program has been implemented, his/her appropriate  
    number of assignments will be judged since the time he/she is first  
    scheduled to serve as the Night Duty Commander.  Every reasonable  
    effort will be made to avoid scheduling a captain for more than seven  
    (7) Night Duty Commander assignments over the twenty-four (24) month  
    period of review.  Except where scheduling changes requested by the  
    employee are the cause, a captain found to have served more than  
    seven (7) Night Duty Commander assignments over the twenty-four (24)  
    month period of review may elect to:  (i)  perform fewer Night Duty  
    Commander assignments over the subsequent twenty-four (24) month  
    period equivalent to the amount performed in excess of seven; or  
    (ii)  receive compensation equivalent to 1% of their annual base pay  
    for each Night Duty Commander assignment performed in excess of  
    seven.  In the event a captain elects to perform fewer Night Duty  
    Commander assignments, that lower number of scheduled assignments  
    will be the standard by which they will be reviewed following the  
    subsequent twenty-four (24) month period.  
  
        e.  The parties agree to conduct labor-management meetings prior  
    to  
  
     implementation of the Night Duty Commander rotation to discuss  
    issues relating to implementation.  In the event issues that are  
    mandatory subjects of bargaining remain unresolved, implementation of  
    the Night Duty Commander rotation and the related pay for such duties  
    shall be delayed until those issues are resolved through negotiation,  
    mediation or arbitration.  Following implementation, labor-management  
    meetings shall be periodically conducted to review the Night Duty  
    Commander rotation and to resolve any issues that may arise in  
    connection with the pilot program.  
  
    2.  Effective July 2, 2003 or the date the Night Duty Commander  
    pilot program is implemented, whichever is later, and while a Night  
    Duty program is in effect, as provided by paragraph II.1 above, the  
    new base salary schedule for captain shall be as follows:  
  
            Start  6 mos  18 mos  30 mos  
  
    Police Captain/    $7,795  $8,111  $8,447  $8,784  
  
    Night Duty Commander  
  
    Police Captain - Precinct/  
  
    Night Duty Commander  
  
    Monthly Equivalent in Dollars  $234  $243  $253  $264  
  
    Longevity premiums based upon the top pay step of the classification  
    Police Lieutenant shall be added to the above salaries in accordance  
    with the following schedules:  
  
    Years of Service  Longevity Percentage       Monthly Equivalent in  
    Dollars  
  
    Completion of fifteen (15)  
  
      years of service     3%    $222  
  
    Completion of twenty (20)  
  
      years of service  4%    $295  
  
    Completion of twenty-five (25)  
  
     years of service  7%  $517  
  
      3.  In the event of any disagreement over the meaning,  
    implementation or application of the terms of this Memorandum of  
    Understanding, such disagreement shall be deemed a grievance and may  
    be addressed by following the procedures set forth in the grievance-  
    arbitration procedure of the Expired Agreement, and for purposes of  
    processing any such grievance, this Memorandum of Understanding  
    expressly incorporates the grievance-arbitration procedure of the  
    Expired Agreement for the duration of this Memorandum of  
    Understanding.  
  
      4.  The Association agrees to withdraw its unfair labor practice  
    complaint in PERC Case No. 16260-U-02-4160 relating to alleged  
    skimming of bargaining unit work upon the City's demonstrating to the  
    Association's satisfaction that the work at issue still remains  
    within the bargaining unit.  
  
      5.  The parties agree to request mediation regarding the unfair  
    labor practice complaint (PERC Case No. 15867-U-01-4033) filed by the  
    Association regarding the psychologist position.
