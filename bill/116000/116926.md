    AN ORDINANCE relating to drainage services of Seattle Public  
    Utilities (SPU); updating definitions in Section 21.33.010 of  
    the Seattle Municipal Code; amending Section 21.33.030 of the  
    Seattle Municipal Code to adjust drainage rates; and amending  
    Section 21.76.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code to revise  
    credits to low-income drainage customers.  
  
    WHEREAS, drainage rates were last increased on January 1,  
    2010, as authorized by Ordinance 123172; and  
  
    WHEREAS, in 2008, a new drainage rate design authorized by  
    Resolution 30886 was implemented for the first time, which  
    specifies the funding of a portion of combined sanitary and  
    storm sewer expenses (including some wastewater treatment  
    expense) through drainage rates; and  
  
    WHEREAS, Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) has identified  
    additional infrastructure needs requiring capital funding,  
    including combined sewer overflow projects at Windermere,  
    Genesee and South Henderson, a CSO long term control plan,  
    sewer pipe rehabilitation and flooding control and sanitary  
    sewer capacity; and  
  
    WHEREAS, SPU has completed a rate study showing that existing  
    drainage rates will not provide sufficient revenues to pay the  
    costs of providing drainage services and debt service and that  
    rate increases therefore are required; and  
  
    WHEREAS, credits for qualified low-income customers need to be  
    revised to reflect an increase in drainage rates; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City updated and revised it Stormwater, Grading,  
    and Drainage Control Code in 2009, as authorized by Ordinance  
    123105, and such updates require corresponding updates to  
    certain definitions that govern storm drain utility rates and  
    charges; NOW THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1. Subsections L and W of Section 21.33.010 of the  
    Seattle Municipal Code are amended as follows:  
  
    SMC 21.33.010 Definitions  
  
    For purposes of this chapter, the words or phrases below shall  
    have the  
  
    following meanings:  
  
    * * *  
  
    L. "Impervious surface" or "impervious ground cover"  means  
    "Impervious surface" as defined in Section 22.801 of the  
    Seattle Municipal Code, as may be amended from time to time.  
     ((  means those hard areas which prevent or  
    retard the entry of water into the soil in the manner that  
    such water entered the soil under natural conditions pre-  
    existent to development, or which cause water to run off the  
    surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow  
    than that present under natural conditions pre-existent to  
    development, including, but not limited to, such surfaces as  
    rooftops, asphalt or concrete paving, driveways, parking lots,  
    walkways, patio areas, storage areas, hardpan, compacted  
    surfaces, or other surfaces which similarly affect the natural  
    infiltration or runoff patterns existing prior to development.  
    ))  
  
    * * *  
  
    W. "Stormwater performance goals" mean ((  the  
    standards for)  )  minimum requirements for  
    flow control and treatment   
  
    ((  1. water quality as shown by total suspended  
    solids;    
  
     2. total volume;    
  
     3. two-year peak volume and duration; and  
  
  
     4. twenty-five-year peak volume  
    )) as appropriate for the drainage discharge  
    point  and thresholds  as more particularly described  
    in the Stormwater Code Chapters 22.800 through 22.808.  
  
    * * *  
  
    Section 2. Section 21.33.030 of the Seattle Municipal Code is  
    amended as follows:  
  
    SMC 21.33.030  Drainage service charges and drainage rates --  
  
    Schedule -- Exemptions.  
  
    A. A drainage service charge is imposed on every parcel within  
    the City, and the owner(s) thereof, except for the following  
    exempted property(ies):  
  
    1. Houseboats and piers;  
  
    2. That portion of a parcel that is submerged. If the parcel  
    is entirely submerged, the entire parcel is exempt. If a  
    portion of the parcel is submerged, only the submerged part  
    will be exempt and the remainder of the parcel shall be billed  
    as all other properties;  
  
    3. City streets;  
  
    4. State of Washington highways, so long as the State of  
    Washington shall agree to maintain, construct and improve all  
    drainage facilities associated with State highways as required  
    by the Utility in conformance with all Utility standards for  
    maintenance, construction and improvement hereafter  
    established by the Utility and so far as such maintenance,  
    construction and improvements shall be achieved at no cost to  
    the Utility or to the City; and  
  
    5. All other streets, so long as such streets provide drainage  
    services in the same manner as City streets and the owner(s)  
    shall agree to maintain, construct and improve all drainage  
    facilities associated with such streets as required by the  
    Utility in conformance with all Utility standards for  
    maintenance, construction and improvement hereafter  
    established by the Utility and so far as such maintenance,  
    construction and improvements shall be achieved at no cost to  
    the Utility or to the City.  
  
    B. The drainage service charge shall be based upon a parcel's  
    estimated contribution to City-wide surface and storm water  
    runoff. A parcel's run-off is estimated based on its size and  
    surface characteristics, including the amount and type of  
    impervious and pervious surface it contains.  
  
    C. Drainage service charges shall be determined as follows:  
  
    1. Small single-family residential properties shall be  
    assigned to one of four (4) flat rate categories based on a  
    billable area. Within each category, properties will be  
    charged a uniform annual drainage rate per parcel which is  
    calculated based on an estimated average contribution of  
    surface and storm water runoff for the category. The  
    applicable drainage rate shall equal the drainage service  
    charge.  
  
    2. General service and large residential properties shall be  
    assigned to a rate category based on the estimated percent of  
    impervious surface contained within the parcel. Subsequently,  
    properties assigned to the "undeveloped," "light," and  
    "moderate" rate categories that also contain sufficient  
    quantities of highly infiltrative pervious surface cover to  
    meet Utility-defined performance requirements shall be  
    assigned to a "low impact" rate category. A separate drainage  
    rate shall apply to each general service and large residential  
    rate category. The drainage service charge shall be calculated  
    by multiplying the drainage rate, as determined by the  
    parcel's rate category assignment, by the parcel's billable  
    area (rounded to the nearest whole number of a square foot and  
    divided by one thousand). For condominiums, the drainage  
    service charge shall be determined for the entire parcel and  
    then divided evenly among the owners. Present use code, site  
    visits, planimetric maps based on aerial photography, and  
    other information shall be used to estimate the percentage of  
    impervious area.  
  
    D. Drainage rates used in the calculation of drainage service  
    charges shall be the sum of the treatment rate and the system  
    rate, as follows:  
  
    1. Treatment rate: The "treatment rate" shall be the rate  
    required to pay the drainage share of "treatment cost" which  
    is the cost of wastewater treatment, interception and disposal  
    service, and any associated costs necessary to meet Drainage  
    and Wastewater Fund policies. The treatment rate shall be the  
    amount obtained when (a) the projected drainage treatment cost  
    for each rate category is divided by (b) the projected number  
    of billing units in each rate category and the result is  
    multiplied by ((  sixteen and three-tenths  
    percent (116.3%)  ))  one hundred eighteen  
    percent (118.0%)  to cover the costs of taxes ,  ((  
     and  )) low income rate  
    assistance  and other allowances . The projected  
    treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the  
    upcoming calendar year, which may include an adjustment to  
    reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between  
    the drainage share of expected total treatment cost for the  
    current year and the total drainage service charge revenues  
    attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current  
    year. The treatment rate is designed to pass through cost  
    changes driven by King County and may be adjusted by ordinance  
    at any time in response to such charges.  
  
    2. System rate: The "system rate" shall be the rate required  
    to fund the expense associated with operating, maintaining,  
    and constructing the City's surface and stormwater management  
    system, including any share of combined sanitary and  
    stormwater system expense assigned to drainage.  
  
    3. The rate categories and the corresponding annual drainage  
    rates are as follows:

\4. SPU shall provide a 10% reduction in the drainage service charge for parcels containing new or remodeled commercial buildings that, after July 27, 2003, install and utilize rainwater harvesting systems that meet the performance requirement that the systems are sized to use the amount of rain that falls on the roofs of such buildings during a one year, 24-hour storm event. A system that involves indoor uses of rainwater must be permitted by Seattle-King County Department of Health to qualify for the rate reduction. A system that relies solely on the capture and indoor use of rainwater shall qualify for the drainage service charge reduction only if the system is sized to meet the performance requirement stated above. Qualifying for the drainage service charge reduction does not relieve the property owner from the obligation to comply with applicable stormwater and drainage code requirements for the buildings and site.  
  
\5. Open space properties or parcels shall be charged only for the area of impervious surface and at the rate under which the parcel is classified using the total parcel acreage.  
  
E. Each bill shall be rounded to the nearest cent. The minimum annual drainage service charge shall be Five Dollars ($5) per parcel.
