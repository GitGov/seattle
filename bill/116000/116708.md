    AN ORDINANCE relating to drainage and wastewater services of Seattle  
    Public Utilities; amending Section 21.28.040 of the Seattle Municipal Code  
    to adjust wastewater rates; amending Section 21.33.030 of the Seattle  
    Municipal Code to adjust drainage rates; and amending Section 21.76.040 of  
    the Seattle Municipal Code to adjust credits to low-income drainage and  
    wastewater customers.  
  
    WHEREAS, drainage and wastewater rates were last increased on January 1,  
    2009, as authorized by Ordinance 122868; and  
  
    WHEREAS, 2009 drainage and wastewater rates were approved based on a 2007  
    rate study by Seattle Public Utilities ("SPU") that proposed rates for  
    2008 and 2009; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the endorsed 2010 budget anticipated a 2009 rate study that would  
    propose drainage and wastewater rates for 2010 and beyond; and  
  
    WHEREAS, to minimize rate payer impacts during the recession, no new rates  
    were proposed for 2010, resulting in less revenue being available to  
    support drainage and wastewater activities than was assumed in the  
    endorsed budget; and  
  
    WHEREAS, expenditures in the proposed 2010 budget are lower than those in  
    the endorsed budget to reflect revenue constraints; and  
  
    WHEREAS, to achieve lower expenditures, the proposed budget cuts or  
    reduces key capital projects and operations and maintenance ("O&M")  
    activities that support Clean Water Act compliance, flood reduction, water  
    quality improvement, and infrastructure maintenance; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the City Council wishes to raise 2010 drainage and wastewater  
    rates so that these key capital projects and O&M activities can be  
    conducted, and their benefits realized, in 2010; and  
  
    WHEREAS, wastewater and drainage credits for qualified low-income  
    customers, not billed directly by SPU for water or wastewater services,  
    are based on typical residential bills, and credits for such customers  
    need to be revised to reflect changes in wastewater rates;  NOW,  
    THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
          Section 1.  Subsection 21.28.040 B of the Seattle Municipal Code is  
    amended as follows:  
  
      SMC 21.28.040  Wastewater volume charge.  
  
    *  *  *  
  
    B. The wastewater volume rate shall be the sum of the treatment rate, the  
    system rate and, where applicable, the MMRD surcharge, as follows:  
  
    1. Treatment rate: The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay  
    the wastewater share of "treatment cost" which is the cost of wastewater  
    treatment, interception and disposal services and any associated costs  
    required to meet Drainage and Wastewater Fund financial policies. The  
    treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected  
    wastewater treatment cost is divided by (b) the projected billed  
    wastewater consumption, each for the next calendar year, and the result is  
    multiplied by one hundred sixteen and seven-tenths percent (116.7%) to  
    cover the costs of taxes and low income rate assistance. The projected  
    treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming  
    calendar year, which may include an adjustment to reflect the difference,  
    whether positive or negative, between the total expected treatment cost  
    for the current year and the total wastewater volume charge revenues  
    attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. The  
    treatment rate is designed to pass through cost changes driven by King  
    County and may be adjusted by ordinance at any time in response to such  
    charges.  
  
    2. System rate: The "system rate" shall be the rate required to pay the  
    cost of carrying and discharging all wastewater and any wastewater funded-  
    share of stormwater into the City sewerage system, as presently maintained  
    and operated and as may be added to, improved and extended.  
  
    3.  The wastewater volume rate shall be in accordance with the following  
    schedule:

Section 2. Subsection 21.33.030 D of the Seattle Municipal Code is amended as follows:  
  
SMC 21.33.030 Drainage service charges and drainage rates - Schedule - Exemptions.  
  
\* \* \*  
  
D. Drainage rates used in the calculation of drainage service charges shall be the sum of the treatment rate and the system rate, as follows:  
  
\1. Treatment rate: The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay the drainage share of "treatment cost" which is the cost of wastewater treatment, interception and disposal service, and any associated costs necessary to meet Drainage and Wastewater Fund policies. The treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected drainage treatment cost for each rate category is divided by (b) the projected number of billing units in each rate category and the result is multiplied by one hundred sixteen and three-tenths percent (116.3%) to cover the costs of taxes and low income rate assistance. The projected treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming calendar year, which may include an adjustment to reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between the drainage share of expected total treatment cost for the current year and the total drainage service charge revenues attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. The treatment rate is designed to pass through cost changes driven by King County and may be adjusted by ordinance at any time in response to such charges.  
  
\2. System rate: The "system rate" shall be the rate required to fund the expense associated with operating, maintaining, and constructing the City's surface and stormwater management system, including any share of combined sanitary and stormwater system expense assigned to drainage.  
  
\3. The rate categories and the corresponding annual drainage rates are as follows:
