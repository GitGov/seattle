This project provides for the development of a district skateboard park at Delridge Playfield. The skatepark will provide skating opportunities in West Seattle and implements a recommendation of the 2007 Citywide Skatepark Plan. It will be an innovative skate park that can accommodate a variety of features and different skill levels.  
  
This project is part of the 2008 Parks Levy, which designated a small skatedot at Myrtle Reservoir Park. In 2009, the Skateboard Park Advisory Committee recommended that this funding be used for the Delridge Skateboard Park instead of the skatedot at Myrtle. The 2008 Parks Levy Citizens Oversight Committee concurred and also recommended providing funding from the 2000 Pro Parks Levy Opportunity Fund for this project.
