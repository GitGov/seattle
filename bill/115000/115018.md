    AN ORDINANCE relating to the City of Seattle 2005-2008 Consolidated  
    Plan for Housing and Community Development; adopting the Consolidated  
    Plan, including certain policies governing the use of funds for  
    housing, and authorizing its submission to the United States  
    Department of Housing and Urban Development.  
  
    WHEREAS, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development  
    ("HUD") has required local jurisdictions seeking federal assistance to  
    develop a Consolidated Plan to bring together the principal housing  
    planning documents and the applications for four federal formula grant  
    programs, including the Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG"),  
    HOME Investment Partnerships, Emergency Shelter Grant  ("ESG"), and  
    Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS ("HOPWA") programs, in one  
    document; and  
  
    WHEREAS, the Mayor has proposed the 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan for  
    Housing and Community Development, including the 2005 Table of  
    Proposed Projects, and has requested that the City Council adopt the  
    Plan and authorize its submission to HUD; and  
  
    WHEREAS, there has been a public involvement process in the  
    development of the Mayor's Proposed 2005-2008 Consolidated Plan for  
    Housing and Community Development and that document has been available  
    for public review and comment for thirty (30) days; the Mayor and City  
    Council have considered the public comments on the proposed plan and  
    have made such revisions as they have considered appropriate in the  
    public interest;  
  
    NOW, THEREFORE,  
  
    BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF SEATTLE AS FOLLOWS:  
  
    Section 1.  The Seattle City Council hereby adopts the 2005-2008  
    Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development, attached  
    hereto as Attachment 1 ("Adopted Plan"), for the purposes and subject  
    to the conditions, limitations and potential amendments as set forth  
    in this ordinance.  
  
    Section 2.  
  
    A.   The Adopted Plan, with any amendments as authorized in this  
    ordinance, shall serve as the City's application to HUD for the grant  
    funding for the programs set forth in the recitals above for the  
    federal fiscal year 2005 and, as supplemented by Action Plans to be  
    adopted in future years, shall serve as the City's application for  
    such grant funding in fiscal years 2006-2008.  The Adopted Plan is  
    intended to serve the functions described in 24 CFR Section 91.1(b).  
    Except as may be required by federal law applicable to consolidated  
    plans, or as expressly set forth in this Section 2, the terms of the  
    Adopted Plan are not intended to have further or additional legal  
    effect.  
  
    B.  In addition, the policies set forth in the sections of Appendix H  
    to the Adopted Plan that are listed on Attachment 2 to this ordinance  
    are adopted to provide direction for the use by the Office of Housing  
    of the fund sources indicated in those sections for the programs  
    indicated.  Those policies may be amended only by ordinance.  As of  
    January 1, 2005, those policies supersede the Housing Funding Policies  
    contained in the City's 2001-2004 Consolidated Plan, as amended  
    ("Existing Plan").  The Housing Funding Policies in the Existing Plan,  
    as well as the other Citywide Funding Policies and policies for  
    specific neighborhoods in the Existing Plan, shall have no further  
    effect after December 31, 2004, except that policies in the Existing  
    Plan expressly applicable to use of funds appropriated through 2004  
    shall continue to apply to the use of those funds after 2004, and  
    where funds are awarded or reserved for projects by the Office of  
    Housing prior to January 1, 2005, funds appropriated through 2004 may  
    be used after 2004 for those projects, consistent with the policies in  
    the Existing Plan, without regard to any change in policy reflected in  
    the Adopted Plan.  The policies in the sections listed on Attachment 2  
    to this ordinance do not supersede policies adopted for the 2002  
    Housing Levy (or any prior housing levy); however, where the policies  
    in those sections of Appendix H to the Adopted Plan expressly apply to  
    housing levy funds, those policies provide additional direction for  
    the use of those funds.  
  
    Section 3.  The Adopted Plan contains, in addition to strategies and  
    policies being adopted by the City for the purposes stated in Section  
    2, descriptions of various existing or proposed ordinances, rules,  
    programs, strategies or policies of the City, its departments or  
    offices, or other agencies such as the Seattle Housing Authority.  
    Those descriptions are intended to describe or summarize ordinances,  
    rules, programs, strategies or policies that are adopted, and may be  
    revised or amended, independent of the Adopted Plan, and not to  
    require amendment of the Adopted Plan for any changes to them, nor to  
    modify or supersede existing ordinances, programs or policies, nor to  
    give such strategies or policies any new or additional legal effect.  
  
    Section 4.  The allocations set forth in the Adopted Plan do not  
    constitute appropriations or modify the amounts of any existing  
    appropriations, nor are they to be considered as final funding  
    decisions.  The authority of the respective City departments and  
    offices to implement the activities set forth in the Adopted Plan is  
    subject to sufficient appropriations in the 2005 Adopted Budget or in  
    any separate ordinance.  Implementation of any specific project or  
    program is also subject to a final determination by the appropriate  
    office or department after completion of any necessary review under  
    environmental and related laws.  No part of the Adopted Plan is  
    intended to confer any legal rights or entitlements on any persons,  
    groups or entities.  
  
    Section 5.  The Mayor and the Director of Human Services ("the  
    Director") and their designees are hereby authorized to submit the  
    Adopted Plan, together with any necessary supplementary material, to  
    the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD")  
    as the application by the City for financial assistance under certain  
    HUD programs; to represent the City in seeking HUD approval of the  
    Adopted Plan, to make and submit to  
  
    HUD such modifications to the Adopted Plan as HUD may require,  
    provided that no substantial policy changes are involved; and to sign  
    and deliver on behalf of the City such assurances and certifications  
    as may be necessary to obtain HUD approval.  The Director is further  
    authorized to make such technical and conforming changes to the  
    Adopted Plan as she may deem reasonably necessary, and to amend the  
    Adopted Plan, if necessary or appropriate under federal regulations,  
    to reflect funding of specific activities, final appropriations for  
    the programs or lines of business in any Adopted Budget, or changes in  
    activities that are consistent with the policies and priorities  
    established in the Plan.  Any substantial amendment as defined by the  
    adopted Citizen Participation Plan for the Consolidated Plan, as  
    adopted by Ordinance 121083, shall be effective only if approved by  
    ordinance or resolution of the City Council.  
  
    Section 6.  No later than July 15, 2005, the Director shall submit a  
    proposed ordinance with amendments to the 2005 Table of Proposed  
    Projects to the City Council's Housing, Human Services and Health  
    Committee. The amendments to the 2005 Table of Proposed Projects shall  
    identify any revised allocations made by the Director prior to such  
    submission, and any further revisions to allocations proposed,  
    relating to the Community Development Block Grant, HOME Investment  
    Partnerships, Emergency Shelter Grant, and Housing Opportunities for  
    Persons with AIDS programs.  
  
    Section 7.  
  
    A.  By March 31, 2005, the Director of the Office of Housing will  
    provide a report to the Housing, Human Services and Health Committee  
    on possible revisions to the HomeWise Single Family Rehabilitation  
    Program funding, structure and staffing.  This report will include  
    information on the following:  Obtaining additional private or non-  
    profit resources to leverage City funding resulting in an expanded  
    HomeWise program; targeting a portion of program funding to certain  
    neighborhoods for use, in part, as a revitalization tool in distressed  
    neighborhoods while also continuing to provide program funding to  
    serve fixed-income elderly city-wide; modifying program goals and  
    repair priorities to permit the use of program funds for targeted  
    revitalization efforts.  
  
    B.  By April 29, 2005, the Director of Human Services shall provide to  
    the Housing, Human Services and Health Committee, a draft of the  
    proposed Request for Proposal (RFP) for Shelter and Transitional  
    Housing Services.  HSD will develop an outcome-based RFP for these  
    services that incorporates the following:  minimum physical and  
    programmatic standards for shelters (which can vary depending on the  
    type of shelter, with potential examples including a "winter response"  
    shelter, "interim" shelter, or longer term shelter for the chronically  
    homeless). These standards shall be consistent with the  
    recommendations contained in King County's Plan to End Homelessness as  
    well as other City policies.  The RFP will also include outcome goals  
    for transitional housing services.  The draft RFP shall be submitted  
    to the Housing, Human Services and Health Committee for review before  
    issuing the RFP in 2005.  
  
    Section 8.  Any action pursuant to the authority and prior to the  
    effective date of this ordinance is hereby ratified and confirmed.  
  
    Section 9.  This ordinance shall take effect and be in force thirty  
    (30) days from and after its approval by the Mayor, but if not  
    approved and returned by the Mayor within ten (10) days after  
    presentation, it shall take effect as provided by Municipal Code  
    Section 1.04.020.
